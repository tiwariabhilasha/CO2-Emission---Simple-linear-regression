Seat pitch is listed as 31"" but felt more like 28"". Width is listed as 17"" and that felt about right. Seat configuration is 3-4-3 which is pretty much standard. It was just too cramped again I believe the pitch that Lufthansa list is wrong as I've never felt so tight with a 31"" pitch and I've recently lost 25 pounds. All else was great. Food was above industry standard staff were polite and attentive after meal drinks were plentiful and included brandy wine and beer at no charge. Snacks were passed out during duration of flight. Flight entertainment was weak but having a place to charge my laptop was handy as well as WiFi although slow and charged at 17euro.

4,United States,5.0,1,eva-air,,Economy,,10.0,I wasn't sure about this airline when booking they far exceeded my expectations in just about every category. The one area that needs immediate improvement is the quality of the food or maybe our western taste buds are overmatched by the eastern style menu. In my opinion the food quality was horrible. But in every other category this airline is well above standard. It begins with the crew who hustles at every opportunity and provides an excellent customer service experience. The cleanliness of the aircraft was noticeable the bathrooms were kept clean and the staff were genuinely friendly. I'd rate these guys as 5 star easily 5 star. Two last notes due to the length of their flights I would recommend adding additional video content. And for some reason on our last leg (TPE-LAX) the a/c was set at an especially cold setting with most passengers resorting to their coats during flight All other legs (LAX-TPE TPE-BKK and BKK-TPE) were fine.,4.0,1/10/2014,5.0,,5.0,2.0,A Acosta,0,0,0

Check in all ok at the airport but once on the plane the partner of the man seated next to me in row 2 made a huge fuss about my son (who was sitting quietly and minding his own business) being in the cabin to which the female crew member replied 'I agree but there's nothing I can do about it'. The other male crew member was 'too busy' to bring an infant lap belt once the doors had closed and I was offered neither a drink or a meal.

6,United States,3.0,0,us-airways,,Economy,,1.0,On November 5 2014 I flew US Airways - what a mistake. I am disabled and my husband checked the night before to make sure a wheelchair would be ready at the airport. Seattle to Tucson via Phoenix. No wheelchair in Seattle finally after waiting at check-in for 45 minutes the desk clerk was worried I was going to miss the flight and grabbed a wheel chair and I was put on plane at the last minute. Arrived at Phoenix - no wheelchair - person working at desk ignored me. Another passenger interrupted her and told her I needed assistance and I finally got help. Arrived in Tucson - no wheelchair - had to walk from tarmac to baggage. Wheelchair available for another customer - asked the person if he could get one for me he shrugged his shoulders and walked off. Customer service a nightmare - do not want to talk to you in person.

I could choose 2 drinks. The meals service had two choices: 1) meat ball with couscous, salad and chocolate cake. 2) tuna salad, some fruits and a honey cake. After the meal service the lights inside the cabin were turned off. Every hour one of the cabin crew members came around with water. During the whole flight there was juice available in the rear galley. Two hours before landing the cabin crew gave us a second meal. Omelette, bun, butter, salad and lemon cake (that was very good).

10,Finland,1.0,0,airbaltic,,Economy,,1.0,I chose this company as it had good fares for our trip however by the end of the trip if I sum up all the expenses it required along the way I could have bought tickets for a better airline that provides all the needed services. We had to pay 10 eur per person to do check-in at the counter. Who has heard of that? We received an email a few days before with the online check-in and it didn't state anywhere that if we don't do it online we would have to pay at the airport. Not surprisingly at the airport everyone who was on the same flight with us had the very same problem. The company is not transparent with its customers and it uses these hidden fees so they can cover up their margins. We had to pay extra for every 20 kg piece of luggage seats transaction fees and there were no meals during the flights. So adding up all these costs to the initial price of the ticket I could have easily flown with an all inclusive airline. Coming to customer service it seems that Air Baltic has no idea what that means. One crew member was extremely rude during the boarding process. She replied to my questions in a very rude way. It is sad to see that for some companies the idea of customer service is still a new concept.,1.0,7/31/2014,1.0,,3.0,1.0,A Agapi,0,0,0

14,Maldives,1.0,0,srilankan-airlines,,Economy,,1.0,BKK-CMB-MLE. Handling agents at BKK were very poorly informed on running the system numerous problems arose and it took over an hour to check in. During check-in they informed us that the CMB-MLE leg of our trip had been cancelled and that we that it was rescheduled for next morning. At CMB we asked the information counter about the transit hotel assigned to us at BKK. They claimed to have never heard of it and were no help at all whatsoever. All this happened in the middle of the night so we were really frustrated. The woman at the transit counter was exceptionally rude. We were then put on a bus with some other passengers and were brought to a small and very dirty little inn quite a long way from the airport. On the way to BKK the MLE handling agents refused to check us in saying that our ticket (issued by SriLankan) was for 15 days while our visa covered only 14. Right from the ticket agents to the transit hotels this was a ghastly experience.,,12/14/2010,,,,,A Ahmed,0,0,0
15,United Kingdom,3.0,0,british-airways,Solo Leisure,First Class,A320,3.0,"LHR-NCL-LHR. I was rather disappointed to learn that my early morning Sunday flight was cancelled without any reason on the afternoon before the morning I was to fly - the whole point of this trip was so I could easily go back and return the same day to attend my sisters wedding, saving time and also money due to the trains being so expensive. I managed to rearrange my flight for the previous night and while annoyed I had to now arrange last minute accommodation, I thought this would be straightforward and as far as re-booking it was via the BA app. What it didn't tell me was that the flight I re-arranged to fly out with was severely delayed and my heart sank as I received a a text/app notification telling me so - I think this was very sneaky not to mention before re-booking and I spent a couple of hours getting to know Terminal 5. The general feedback from here and from friends is flights on this particular domestic route are often subject to delays and cancellation, and for a full service airline that is simply unacceptable - more than anything when everything else is cutback, reliability becomes golden. The plane itself was immaculately maintained and clean and I liked the simple but elegant cabin. BA staff also do let things down a bit, often quite brusque and unfriendly, and the desk staff do come across rather insincere when there are issues as there was here. Cabin Crew were fine, but lack warmth of some other Airlines. Sadly there aren't any other options on this route, so will probably be switching back to rail, despite sometimes competitive fares.",,6/18/2015,3.0,LHR to NCL,3.0,3.0,A Ahmed,0,0,0

17,United Kingdom,3.0,0,flybe,,Economy,,4.0,"STN-NCL. The booking process is confusing and unclear there is a constant feeling you're trying to be tricked into paying for things you don't want. Online check in did not work and seems to be a common recurring problem going by other reviews here I fly with only hand baggage for these short hops so I can arrive later at the airport and walk through without having to queue at a desk - this defeats the point of this if I have to check-in the old-fashioned way. Of course I didn't get a window seat because they had been taken and I didn't want to pay the obscene charge to pre-select. They chose Stansted for this route - this airport is decrepit and dark security is overcrowded and a mess with poor management of queues. Moving on to boarding - the misinformation flyBe give which adds to passengers frustration - we were told we had to be at the gate 45 minutes before the flight this is excessive and pointless. Arriving at the gate the board said it was open - it wasn't with no one about. Then it said they were boarding again it wasn't. Then finally 15 minutes before the depart time said gate was closed - we haven't even boarded. We didn't board until the scheduled depart time. Boarding was on foot in the rain with no bus or sheltered path. Upon boarding it was clear the Dash 8 Q400 aircraft had seen better days cabin looked very tatty and tired and a lot of passengers didn't seem to be aware of the size limitations for cabin baggage boarding took significantly longer than it should have. The seat itself was thin hard and unsupportive and looked very tatty with scratches and frayed bits hanging off. Departed 15 minutes late with no explanation or reason given for the delay. Cabin Service Manager was friendly but her colleague was surly and stroppy. FlyBe like to pretend they are above the low-cost carriers such as easyJet but they are anything but and this is very poor replacement for the easyJet's flight from/to Gatwick that were ended at the end of March - not only with the odd flight times and use of Stansted but also because of the poor quality of their short-haul product. It's ironic with their current tag line of ""Faster than road or rail"" they are trying to compete with these forms of transport but with the delays it is anything but and the overall experience is so joyless - it is doing the opposite and I will probably save the hassle and get the train next time.",0.0,4/8/2015,2.0,,1.0,2.0,A Ahmed,0,0,0
18,United Kingdom,5.0,1,emirates,,Economy,,9.0,NCL-DXB-DAC-DXB-NCL. Departed from NCL on newest 777-300ER with newest ICE system flight very full but experience was overall pleasant. Catering from NCL is generally always good there was nothing to complain about and staff were efficient and generally good if not over-friendly. Flight from DXB-DAC was on time and again very full on older 777-200 with older ICE system. Cabin Crew on this sector were excellent however and even checked in on my mother who had been upgraded to Business Class for us. Toilets in ridiculous state given 4 hour flight but again due to clientele rather than crews fault. Return was on Christmas Eve and surprisingly busy flight from DAC-DXB. Return flight is always over-timed by an hour - meant we didn't get on to the plane until an hour after arriving at the gate. Flight was on newer 777-200ER with newest ICE system. Cabin service was efficient and brusque if not necessarily very friendly and inflight catering was ok. Arrival into Dubai was early and the airport was very quiet - we had a wait of more than 4 hours for connection to NCL - so collected our complimentary food vouchers from transfer desk. DXB-NCL unusually on 3 class 777-300ER with newest ICE system. Cabin Crew were unusually mostly British due to a lot returning home for Christmas break. Catering was disappointing with choice particularly breakfast offering but otherwise pleasant. Arrival into NCL was late and held on tarmac for rather unusual amount of time before being parked at remote stand and bussed to terminal. Baggage out promptly. Would use again based on this experience - the sector DAC is never an easy one and on the whole Emirates made the experience rather more tolerable than it can be and the price was incredible value for money especially long-haul from a regional UK destination.,5.0,4/24/2014,4.0,,3.0,4.0,A Ahmed,0,0,0
19,United Kingdom,5.0,1,icelandair,Solo Leisure,Economy,Boeing 757,8.0,"LGW-KEF-PDX, PDX-KEF, KEF-LHR. I flew to Portland to visit friends with a 4 day stopover on the way back in Iceland which is included at no extra cost. I think I agree with the review by M Brown on the 20th March, people are being are rather unfair particularly with regards to the catering situation on Icelandair - they are very clear on what the product being offered here is and there is opportunity once booked to add food from the regular menu at a discount before flying and this is served to you before the main food service begins. I only pre-ordered food outbound on the long-haul KEF-PDX sector and found what was served to be delicious and good value. All non-alcoholic drinks are complimentary and can be requested at any time during the flight. All sectors were on B757, which whilst relatively old were immaculately maintained. Outbound from Gatwick the plane was a bit older and had no IFE, but this was ok for the short flight to Reykjavík and I was notified 24hrs prior to departure of this via text. On the long-haul sector from Keflavík to Portland the aircraft was more the Icelandair standard product and we were presented with bottle of Icelandic water which was a nice touch. There was IFE on this sector but it was very old, with poor quality picture and didn't have a fantastic selection - but I had brought my own entertainment with me anyway. The staff however on this flight were fantastic and really worked hard to be friendly and attentive to passengers needs so much so I will be writing to Icelandair to tell them so! Flying back to Reykjavík was pleasant with blankets and cushions provided for this overnight sector and IFE was newer and the the best of all the sectors with a clear picture. My return to London a few days later was also fine with everything on schedule and generally pleasant. One thing that didn't work on any sector was mobile boarding passes - this didn't work on a single sector for me, but I easily received a paper version in most cases. Apart from little niggles which made the experience less than perfect overall I was satisfied with my experience, it was fantastic value for money with the added plus of the stopover and would be very happy to use them again.",1.0,6/21/2015,4.0,LGW/LHR to PDX via KEF,3.0,4.0,A Ahmed,0,0,0
20,United Kingdom,5.0,1,garuda-indonesia,,Economy,,9.0,LGW-AMS-LGW. Price for the May Day Bank Holiday weekend was fantastic value. A small gripe is that you can't fully check-in online at the moment although seats selected up to 24hr prior to flight are usually honoured upon completing check-in at the airport and I know Garuda are working on this adding the ability to have mobile boarding passes. For now this does mean having to arrive a little early at the airport even if you only have hand baggage and completing check-in manually which is probably more of an issue on this short-hop sector than is likely for a full long-haul flight. Outbound this wasn't such an issue as there wasn't much of a queue but Inbound there was a considerable queue at Schiphol for economy check-in. Check-in staff were very efficient however and warm and friendly. Outbound flight left a little late with a short delayed arrival in Schiphol. Aircraft was an immaculately maintained fairly new 777-300ER in 9 abreast layout with good comfortable seating. The interior was beautifully designed and reflective of Indonesian culture. AVOD was ok although not as comprehensive as on some other carriers. Kept informed by Pilot and announcements in English Indonesian and Dutch. On both sectors Cabin Crew were great and immaculately presented. The crew on the inbound flight were much warmer which I preferred. The slight disappointment was the small snack served with only water which is virtually identical on both sectors. Whilst I don't expect anything on short-haul flights and have flown on low-cost carriers on flights that have cost more and not received anything this is a full service carrier with a 5-star rating and what was served was below the standard I was expecting from a full-service short-haul product. Small gripes aside I would use Garuda again.,4.0,5/10/2015,5.0,,5.0,3.0,A Ahmed,0,0,0

22,United Kingdom,4.0,1,norwegian,,Economy,,9.0,EDI-ARN-EDI. They text you flight details on opening of check-in (2 hours before the flight) along with gate number which is useful information. Manual check-in only at Edinburgh as they do not offer online check-in however no queues. Older B737-300 and did not have wifi available. They did have the new slimline leather seats and seat pitch was more than adequate but for those taller than 5'6 it maybe more of an issue. Staff on board were friendly and onboard food available to buy was reasonably priced and looked of good quality. Landed in Stockholm early. Return flight similar to outgoing. Norwegian take part in Arlanda's common check-in kiosk system which allows you to check-in at Stockholm Central Railway Station before catching the Arlanda Express. Baggage allowance is generous and flexible. Landing at Arlanda is a big bonus as is allocation of seats before boarding and the overall service is worth the little bit extra over the competing service offered by Ryanair to Skavsta (which isn't even in Stockholm) - also without the general unpleasantness with that operator.

23,United Kingdom,4.0,1,kenya-airways,,Economy,,5.0,Just last week I was on another Kenya Airways flight but this time the experience far from what I'd expected. The aircraft itself had only just returned to Nairobi with a full load of passengers about an hour before we boarded it. Of course it had been prepared for our flight but not well enough - the toilet I used even before departure was grubby the carpeting on the floor of the passenger cabin still had tiny remnants of a food spill from the previous flight the inflight entertainment system worked only partly - the flight tracker did not work at all throughout the 8 hr flight to Amsterdam - the choice in movies and music was so limited and the sound quality so inadequate. A far cry from the very enjoyable flight on the KLM B747-400 that had flown me on the outward leg.

First time using a full service airline domestically after mostly using EasyJet for couple of years and this Little Red offshoot of VS didn't disappoint. Aer Lingus should given a massive pat of the back for the fantastic service they are delivering on behalf of Virgin Atlantic. Flights were on time and inflight service was more than one could ask for a short-haul domestic flight with friendly and attentive staff. I was delayed inbound back from Edinburgh but that was due to a security scare at that Airport and I was notified with plenty of time via email and text and allowed me time spend a few more hours with friends in Edinburgh. The one Achilles heel is Heathrow I haven't used Heathrow in 16 years - and I have to say it didn't leave me want to back in a hurry unfriendly and poor management of queues for security - for Britain's premier air gateway it is shambolic particularly when you see the improvements that have been made at Gatwick. Virgin should be proud of the service they are delivering here though I am using them again in January on this domestic route and will be sad to see this end in September 2015.

The toilets were much cleaner than on other airliners' planes which was nice. Food was really good and it felt luxurious to be able choose from two menus! They showed quite new movies during the flight but when we flew back to Helsinki there was no sound coming from the audio system. This problem affected all the passengers not just me. The flight attendant couldn't do anything about this problem. What really upset me was the cabin crew's attitude on safety matters. Flight attendants didn't care at all about the position of passengers' seats tray tables or hand luggage during take off and landing. It definitely didn't give a good impression of safety issues.

Catering was a sandwich and a choice of Hot drinks Soft drinks and Moldovan Wine. No IFE but not a problem on a 3hr flight. Only strange aspects were the very stocked duty free trolley coming through the plane but with absolutely no price lists or catalogues so I had no idea what they were selling and that the cockpit messages to staff were in Romanian which surprised me as most airlines now do them in English. Just one quick note be prepared to be locked in the airport for a while. My luggage actually came through first but when I cleared customs and headed for the exit I could see my friends waiting for me but the doors taking me landside were locked after much rattling around 10 mins later a staff member came and pressed the button to let us out!

The information given was completely incorrect as the desks opened 4 hrs before departure and all seats were taken by then which was very frustrating and disappointing.

Return flight on EY21 on the 29th of December light load in J class we were well looked after by the excellent crew in J. as usual EY's catering is excellent cabin crew attentive and good hard product.

30,Austria,4.0,0,turkish-airlines,,Business Class,,4.0,Although seats are very good there are severe limitations: Istanbul Airport offers no extra tracks for Business class passengers which means that you have to line up with all the others in the middle of the night/early in the morning (usually) to pass the overcrowded security checks. There is a fast track lane but it was always closed when I needed to pass it (4 times in the past 2 months). Istanbul airport is deplorable not coping with the rapid expansion of TK. This means that your expensive Business class experiences finds a rather unpleasant middle piece. Even more disturbing is the very wrong catering service concept and staff quality. Usually one pays for an expensive business class seat to find rest and piece and some sleep. TK assumes that you are in it for the culinary experience and serve food regardless of the flying time thus limiting the rest time severely. For instance while flying from Istanbul to Cape Town TK started serving dinner at midnight for over 3 hours. Then they wake you up 2 hours before landing to serve breakfast. Even worse is that the crew is serving and removing the food very noisily moving plates glasses etc for hours. The 11 hours flight to Cape Town thus had only 3 hours of quite sleeping time. Worst affected are the first and last rows of the business class being close to the pantry. Another bad example was the flight from Istanbul to Doha: here same procedure: although guests wanted to sleep right after the take-off (midnight again). Food was served almost the entire flight (4 hours). Noise was unbearable as the pantry did not even had a shielding curtain. Besides the fact that the food is nothing special the quality of the crews is very heterogeneous. During the flight to Doha the chief cabin attendant was reading the newspaper drank tea in front of the business class passengers (no curtain) and was observing leisurely the work of his subordinates. The staff chats constantly with each other and although there are more than enough attendants on board it is not possible to place a successful request as the chain of command is long and unclear responsibilities seem to exist.,4.0,1/13/2014,2.0,,5.0,1.0,A Al-Ani,0,0,0

I would rather pay a few extra bucks and fly Emirates or Turkish Airlines. During my flight my seat was broken and I asked the male flight attendant to change my seat. He just gave me a dry response by saying that the flight was full. I was shocked to hear this type of customer service. The least he could have done was to offer to fix the seat. I was sitting on the broken seat for 14 hours. I didn't go to the washroom because 2 of them were leaking and the other was out of order. The IFE system did not work at all and when I asked the flight attendant to fix it he said ok and just disappeared.

Thought it would make the trip easier as younger 2 kids only 5 and 2. Also Business promised overnight hotel accommodation in Abu Dhabi so we justified the huge expense and thought we'd travel in style! Every leg we were seated separately including putting the 2 year old next to strangers. Just assumed I guess we would have seating together. After first leg refused to change seating for other legs. Refused - told we had to wait until on the aircraft and for attendants to approach other passengers to change. Watched anxiously on every leg as they seated and settled every other passenger before they would try to get my kids near us. Arrived late at night after long flight into Abu Dhabi from Sydney expecting hotel room. Airport almost deserted eventually found long line of weary travellers waiting for single attendant. Waited in line for 2 hours with children and adults close to hysterical by then. Eventually reach end of line and are told no booking made for room for us - then later found. Kids in separate hotel room on another floor! Unable even to have adjacent rooms. Service in plane polite but hardly existent. Bell would expire before attended. Twice sent feedback to Etihad. First not even answered second approach through social media got quick request for details which I provided. Response then was not an apology but ""disappointment' at my negative 'impression' of their superior service and well trained staff. They assured me that just because I didn't get my 'preferred seating' (as if I'd just wanted a window seat rather than to be near my children) they win awards for their 'inspired' experience.

This crew were arrogant incompetent with inadequate behavior. As soon as we got the plane there was no welcome. They did not give us blankets and pillows we had to ask for it. When they start serving the dinner they brought everything on the same tray. Starters soup and main dish and of course when we started the main dish it was already cold. No dessert coffee tea offered. Just after they served dinner a small bit of turbulence began the seat belt sign was turned on. Turbulence last for about 5 minutes time for the crew stop the service and started their own dinner leaving everything on the tables. I have been complaining about this flight because it was an absurd. The crew are paid for doing their job.

The cooler wasn't working on the personal mini bar and those two drinks were undrinkable. The entertainment system was good - it had a few nice classics and also a very good selection on new releases .

Please do not take my criticism wrongly Etihad's service on board is one of the best in the business but the end result is what lasts and when you end up in a hotel room getting ready to get on a long awaited cruise holiday without your clothes you begin to ask yourself why on earth did I fly with these people and why did they not re-route me when they knew about the problem but still took the risk with my holiday!,5.0,8/11/2014,5.0,,5.0,5.0,A Althani,0,0,0

No one can fault Qatar Airways class of service they are top notch from the moment you enter into the airport to the moment you pick up your luggage and head home my only draw back is surprise surprise the Dreamliner. The way the layout is you always get distracted by the TV screens of other passengers you cannot concentrate on your reading nor can you watch something peacefully. There is plenty of storage room on the seat but the operating system of the entertainment is a little complicated.

Food was well below my expectations. Returning AUH-JFK was terrible. Check-in took 45 minutes because the agent couldn't print our baggage tags. Boarding and the US ICE Pre- clearance was a breeze and we were among the first to board. My wife a doctor herself 6 months pregnant and traveling with a letter from her physician clearing her for travel suffered the most. Once onboard and in our seats a flight attendant noticed my wife was pregnant and asked for her letter. Flight attendant said that the letter was insufficient (remember that this was the return flight - had already been allowed to fly to AUH and had checked-in at the desk gone through two security checkpoints US Customs and the gate agent) and tried to kick her off the flight. After a ground crew member came to ask about our bags (to remove them from the aircraft) and realizing that they would have to remove 7 passengers and 14 checked bags they allowed us to stay but only after delaying the flight for an hour. Food on the return flight was terrible. Small portions poor selection (didn't give us a menu at all). Considering that the return was a 14 hour flight they should have given us more food during the voyage. At least the rest of the cabin crew was relatively nicer but not overly so.

The entertainment-system is good food and service is also good. Also flew with their A330 which is more comfortable but the entertainment system is really old now. Their best airplanes are without doubt the Boeing 777 which is both comfortable and modern. That's the plane I recommend if you travel with Qatar Airways.

My husband is 6'2 and his knees hit the seat in front of him and that was before the lady in front reclined! She should be allowed to recline as that's the type of seats that the airline claims to be selling but it shouldn't have been at the price of the person sitting behind her. If you didn't recline seats were very rigid and uncomfortable. Staff were ok but that was the only decent thing about the flight. Unfortunately this airline apparently tries to save weight by choosing not to stock their food and drink selection so the flight attendants weren't actually able to meet most peoples request. People were very frustrated by the cramped space limited food and overall crummy flight and some took it out on the flight attendants. This airline obviously cares as little about their employees as their customers since they choose to put their flight attendants in these situations. We called ahead of time to try and switch airlines since we originally booked with Air Canada's regular airline and wanted what we had initially booked. The lady on the phone assured us that the reviews on here were false and the Rouge service was the same as their regular service.

Both flights were about 30 minutes late but these days when a delay is an honest 30 minutes and does not ratchet upwards because of the airline's inability to communicate accurately I actually feel relieved. Legroom is very tight by Western standards but that is understandable since the Vietnamese are elegantly small in stature.

Last week I booked two trips one for a conference and one vacation that my wife is accompanying me on. On my customary call to US Airways to get my ADA accommodation (because there's no way to do this online when you book the seats) I was told that my wife would have to sit separate from me or I'd have to pay for the ""choice seat"". When I explained to the customer service agents they all stated that there is nothing they can do for me as all they had to do under the law was accommodate me and my wife had to pay the fee. I fly at least 12-20 times a year with US Airways and they'd rather offend me by making my wife pay a fee to sit in the disabled row next to me for a lousy $52 each way?

Charge for entertainment headphones didn't buy a set so I also rated entertainment at one star. I fly Delta only because my spouse has Platinum FF status and buys my tickets with her FF miles.

Next month when we fly from California to Florida I'll ask her to book our flight on a Delta partner if possible. The Delta seats are too uncomfortable for long haul flights.

The economy comfort seats from MSP to SMF were adequate decent legroom acceptable recline. Other than legroom they were not much different from the ones on Endeavor Air / Delta Connection from YYZ to MSP. The plastic armrests from MSP-SMF were very uncomfortable. These seats are similar to the ones on Delta international flights. I will no longer fly Delta on internationally and will try another carrier such as KLM on my next trip to Europe.

Economy plus had a little more legroom and padding than economy but the seat recline was almost the same as in economy - I couldn't tell the difference. Based on this experience I would not pay extra for economy plus. Delta charged $2.00 for headsets with which to listen to a movie displayed on overhead screens situated every 4-6 rows. I didn't buy the headsets or food so I can't comment on catering or entertainment. Boarding has turned into an unpleasant experience passengers crowding the gate so they can board first and secure overhead bin space. My flight experience deteriorates each time I fly Delta. My spouse is a Platinum frequent flyer which is the only reason I patronize this airline -- no cost award tickets. I can't wait to fly Southwest or Jet Blue (domestic) or Air France KLM Lufthansa international.

The seats on Endeavour had minimal legroom but more recline and I was able to nap during the two-hour flight to Toronto. The plastic armrests on the SMF-MSP flight were extremely uncomfortable. Economy comfort wasn't worth the money. One star for food and entertainment (I didn't buy food for purchase no entertainment on either flight). My wife has Delta Platinum FF status.

The BAH-BKK legs also only have one meal but you get a piece of cake about 50 mins before landing so not great. Only the way home I had a ten hour layover in Bahrain (overnight) I was not offered the option of a hotel or given any food coupons during this period to say this is poor is an understatement!

My screen only worked on 1 channel so I had 1 film to watch on an 11 hour flight and my husband's TV didn't work at all. On the return journey it could not have been more different.

We decided to upgrade on check-in to Premium Economy and if this option is available I would highly recommend. We paid an extra £180 each to upgrade at last minute and it was worth every penny. The only downside was the delay once we had landed at Fort Lauderdale. Although we landed on time Passport Control and Customs could not handle the sheer volume of passengers/aircraft arriving at the airport at the same time. We were kept waiting a further 2 hours on the aircraft as airport staff would not let us disembark. In total it was 4 hours after landing before we were able to leave Fort Lauderdale airport to begin our holiday. This was the case for every arrival and was not the fault of Norwegian Airlines but it ruined what was otherwise a perfect flight.

Even if I could have avoided the additional fees it would not have been worth the poor service cumbersome website awkward information interface and ineffective communications. The final indignation was that several hours after having moved our departure to a different gate on the concourse someone had neglected to notify the push-away cart of the change. This dropped ball resulted in a completely avoidable further twenty minute delay while we sat on the aircraft waiting for it to get to the new gate to push our aircraft away from the gate.

We were in row 29 therefore obviously we would board at the front of the plane. When we walked in to the plane we got greeted by an unhappy air hostess who told me off for boarding the wrong end of the plane even though this was what we were told. This made us feel very unwelcome onboard. After take off we waited a very long time before drinks and snacks were bought round. They then said we could all fill out a questionnaire regarding Thomas Cook. The air hostess started distributing these but when she got to about row 28 she just walked straight past and ignored the fact that I would have liked to complete one. She seemed stressed and far from happy and lacked customer service. I asked one of the other air hostess's if I could have a questionnaire to complete and she was more than happy to get me one and apologised. The unhappy air hostess then came round collecting rubbish but once again missed us out so we sat for the rest of the trip with cups and wrappers on our tables.

Not a single announcement was made to inform passengers or to guide them to some desk to get assistance or a voucher. Up to 7 am the airline's website kept listing the departure on time at 2 am. The company was not to blame with the delay the airport was experiencing a failure of the lighting system on the runways. The Etihad service desks were swamped with stranded passengers needing to be rebooked. It was madness to try to get to the desks. Etihad staff was trying their best not to been seen. No attempt was made to bring order to chaos. Things did not get any better once I finally arrived in Morocco. Being so late I had missed my connection. No help from Etihad no one in the airport to guide passengers and assist them.,3.0,4/3/2014,1.0,,2.0,2.0,A Bernier,0,0,0
195,United Kingdom,4.0,1,air-transat,,Business Class,,8.0,Flew MAN to YVR in May 14 had flown same route in May 13 and June 11 all times in Club. Have to say for the price it was great. This year we were in row 1 for both legs and these are great seats but they need footrests or footstools. It was a brand new cabin new mood lighting but the service was cheerful and the drinks and snacks constant. Only problem was with trying to pre-book meals on both legs and finally gave up only to be offered what was left on the actual flight but it was good enough. The prices are creeping up. Have flown Club with them in old config and it was fine now with only 12 seats it has pushed up the price quite a bit. Still worth the money for early boarding disembarkation drinks and snacks and peace and quiet in a really small cabin. A real negative though is now in July 14 you can book flights for next year but no seat maps are open. Wonder what is going on there.

Economy Plus is located behind Business Class and it seems to be dark back there because it is by the exit doors and Coach Galley. If you aren't used to or can't afford Business Class on the major airlines this is a nice alternative and I would recommend it. Check-in is easy and the personnel are helpful.

As soon as I got to the airport I was not only surprised by the $40 checked bag fee but the $50 carry on fee. But knowing that a lot of airlines are charging bag fees I paid and moved on. We got to the seating section of the check in and it offered for me to select a seat for additional money or have it randomly picked. I was traveling with someone but thought surely they wouldn't separate passengers traveling together. I was wrong. Then of course they couldn't even offer a free drink. My seat just fit me and I had to have my arms crossed the entire flight. On the flight home I paid $81.00 for a checked bag and the privilege of sitting next to the person I was traveling with. The only positive was the flight attendants traveling home who were extremely funny.

Flight from Belfast was on time and no problems boarding. First thing we noticed on boarding was the narrow space between the seats other passengers commented on this. When I sat down the space to the next seat was so narrow that I was unable to put the food tray down flat. I am 5 ft 5 and found that I was cramped. Other passengers who were taller than I experienced greater discomfort. There was also a lack of overhead storage for all passengers and some had to shove baggage between their legs. On the return journey we were collected from our hotel 20 minutes late. Wen we got to the airport Thomas Cook had 6 check in desks open for people boarding 4 of their flights all leaving within 15 minutes of each other. 4 desks were open for speedy boarding and Thomas Cook were actively trying to sell this service to people in the queue. As a consequence we had little time in the airport to have lunch or shop before boarding. When the plane took off and the set belt sign was switched off most passengers stood for the 4 hour journey. I have travelled with Thomas Cook in the past but their service has declined and they seem to be preoccupied with getting more and more money from passengers. As a seasoned traveller I have never seen such cramped conditions on any plane including so called budget airlines. I will never travel with Thomas Cook again and would not recommend this company to anyone.,1.0,2/2/2013,3.0,,1.0,2.0,A Best,0,0,0

In the event we found the overall product to be high quality and at an operational level all flights departed on time and allowed connections to be made easily. It is true that its down to you to request drinks throughout the flight but requests were met in a friendly way. In fact there was certainly no lack of friendliness or smiles from the cabin crew unlike other reviews on this site. Comfort levels were great in the A330 flat bed sectors the London to IST sectors on the A321 compare very favourably to other carriers short haul business class.

Seats are so cramped that it shames low-cost airlines not only you do you not have enough room but the seats are also very uncomfortable the controls are inaccessible (on the armrests) and recline is very limited.

210,Canada,5.0,1,air-transat,,Economy,,9.0,"From booking with 'Canadian affair' to collecting our luggage on the return flight we were really pleased with Air Transat. Our YYC-LGW return itinerary went almost entirely without flaw. The ticket price for our itinerary saved my spouse and I an excess of $1000 over booking with KLM or Air Canada. We booked our seats in advance (21A & 21B on both flights at $20/seat/flight) and then utilized Transat's new online check-in. The online service was simple and easy to use with a dedicated bag drop and next to no line-up as a result. Our flights were both on refurbished A330-200 Twin engine Wide-body jets. The 9 across configuration Air Transat uses (over the typical 8 on most A330s) was noticeably tight but not impossible or overly uncomfortable and on the outbound flight we lucked out having the block of 3 to ourselves. Mood lighting on both flights was neat to watch and I actually agree that it made a difference in the overall perception of time and minimization of Jet Lag. The two airplanes had differing overhead bin designs the outbound being Airbus's new style curvy bins and the return being their older style. Although this doesn't seem like something the average person would care about the difference determined whether or not the seat had an overhead personal air vent. Only the older style bin aircraft was supplied with this feature - one I hate seeing airlines remove. It made the return flight all the more comfortable to have a little blast of cool air. Legroom on both aircraft was the same and is slightly above the norm I'd say somewhere around 33"" pitch. Transat's new inflight entertainment on the A330's is a great system with plenty of newer mainstream movies TV shows and music to choose from. Even the food onboard was good. On the return the food was more of ""microwave dinner"" calibre - each of us ordering 'orange chicken' but perfectly edible and of good enough taste. They are small though so consider packing a snack or taking advantage of their onboard purchase menu. Upon arrival of both of our ""on time"" flights our bags were delivered in good time even though we did not pay extra for Option Plus or priority baggage services offered. Overall we were incredibly pleased with the Transat Experience after reading some less than satisfactory reviews - and would absolutely fly with this airline (and to this surprisingly easy to access and navigate airport) again.",5.0,7/1/2014,5.0,,4.0,5.0,A Bjorndalen,0,0,0
211,Canada,5.0,1,allegiant-air,,Economy,,7.0,Booked several weeks in advance for a trip from Minot ND to Las Vegas. We paid for advanced seat selection and a checked luggage item at the time of booking. The Allegiant website and online check-in app were incredibly easy and intuitive. I did have difficulty getting the boarding pass to load with the app at first but a couple of tries later it worked. The check in agent in Minot wore a Frontier Airlines uniform and generally was kind of ignorant. The Minot terminal was very cold. The flight was delayed briefly for an issue with an inbound passenger but eventually left about 20 minutes late. Flight was uneventful and went by quickly. I found the MD-83 to be actually quite comfortable even though the seats didn't recline. There was no inflight entertainment system but the onboard magazine was decent and even contained Vegas coupons! We arrived only a little late. The crew was efficient and friendly and even cracked a couple jokes over the PA on arrival and bags dispensed quickly. On the return flight check-in and boarding were pleasant and quick and we left on time. The airplane however was absolutely filthy! The seats were worn the tray tables were slopped all over and even the window had food on it. We had the same crew situation as outbound in that they were efficient friendly and helpful. On arrival to Minot we were early but luggage took 30 minutes to dispense. In the end yes this airline is acceptable. They're certainly inexpensive and the crews are on par with most other carriers.

212,Ireland,1.0,0,ryanair,,Economy,,1.0,Business plus plan: Smoke and Mirrors. I just went on a business trip and took the opportunity of travelling with Ryanair on their new Business plus plan. Just as an aside I fly regularly with Ryanair (no choice) and usually book and pay for all the options so I went for 'all the options' in a package that promised a 'bit' more and cost 70 euros more. The flight was from Dublin to Nice (France). The offering was 1) Flexibility on ticket changes 2) 20kg baggage allowance 3) Fast track airport security 4) Priority boarding and 5) Choose your premium seat. So this was all pretty good and I bought into it all. I did not need to use #1. #2 is standard. #3 I wanted and at Dublin Airport there was a gate for this that put us behind people being let into the fast lane for clearance (no big deal). When it came to the return flight this was not an option. #4 is standard. However at Nice everyone was let through the check in at the same time (there were two queues) and most priority passengers were way to the back of the ensueing melee - all were then herded aboard a couple of busses so no priority. #5 is standard. Bottom Line: Business plus plan is a total fake intended to take more money out of business passengers without giving them anything.,,9/17/2014,3.0,,1.0,0.0,A Blackwell,0,0,0

We were travelling with two young children so the delays were a bit difficult. Legroom was pretty much as I remember other airlines in economy class. The lack of decent entertainment was a pain (only the old monitors up in the aisles where you had to crane your neck to see) but the kids ended up falling asleep anyway. And the movie they played was in Spanish. Dinner was acceptable. Kids had a kids meal as requested. It was disappointing there was no beverage service during the night for those who were awake. I went hunting for a drink of water hoping they'd give me a bottle to tide me over but no just a cup. Having said all that the staff were reasonably friendly and the fare was much cheaper. It saved us around $1200 as a family. So if you don't mind no-frills it's not a bad choice. The domestic leg from Buenos Aires to Lima was on time and efficient.,,6/23/2010,,,,,A Blagrove,0,0,0

After take off we were offered beverages and our meal orders were taken. The samsung in flight entertainment systems were handed out however after looking through the selection I instantly regretted not bringing my own laptop as the selection for a 5hr flight was extremely poor. The 3 course meal was delicious and service was good for most of the flight however I had to wait for the bathroom twice the first time as several economy passengers were using the designated business class bathroom and the second time as 4 members of the crew were talking in the front of the cabin blocking the way. After waiting 15 minutes for them to disburse I stepped through the curtain only to be told that I couldn't be up there and to return to my seat. A few minutes later I was approached by the cabin manager to explain that the first officer was coming out of the cockpit and that is why I was told to return to my seat. I wasn't happy with how they handled the situation. The amenities kit was good however it was not handed out until half way through the flight.

After having paid for tickets for our trip to Costa Rica months in advance we were informed at the gate that our flight was delayed but the check in agent said that we should still be able to make our connecting flight through Denver. So we check our bags ($50 for 2) and go through security. Upon arrival at the gate we were told that we would arrive in Denver at 11:55 p.m. which was the departure time for our connecting flight to Costa Rica. We asked if they would be able to hold the plan for 10 minutes so that we and the 3-4 other passengers who were in the same situation could make the flight. The gate agent said that she had called the staff in Denver and they refused to hold the flight as it would further increase delays. Frustrated we asked to be put on the next flight hoping we could leave the following day at the latest but she told us that the next flight with available seats was in 6 days. We asked to speak to her manager who essentially said that out options were to wait six days or that she could (reluctantly) refund us for the cost of our original flight and book a new flight through a different airline. We had to research flights on our own as they had no intentions of helping us secure seats on a new flight. We ended up paying an additional $400 to book last minute tickets on American Airlines waiting for her to process our refund and get our mailing address to send our checked baggage fee back to us via mail and then rushing to the next terminal to go through security again and catch our flight. Ultimately we paid more than we would have if we'd just booked through American months ago. Plus the lack of customer service or care regarding out situation was infuriating. We are waiting for our flight to Costa Rica as I type this and just praying that they successfully rerouted our bags.

I called the flight attendant over before take off and showed her the problems and asked what can be done. She said there was nothing wrong with the location of my TV and would not look at my broken seat. She just walked off and told me she would be back soon - never came back.

We go to rural Spain and I doubt we will find an Internet cafe now when everyone has wifi and Ipads I think they have all closed down. So now will have to pay for allocated seats and need to remember this when working out whether Ryanair are cheaper than Monarch.,,6/8/2014,5.0,,4.0,1.0,A Bolton,0,0,0

I have flown many airlines and have never had such a bad flying experience. The staff were very rude and all the unexpected fees doubled my price. It is no savings with a small carry on at $50 dollars and if I want to sit by my child had to pay $18 dollars for seats together. So my payment went up $136 each way.. not so great the plane smelled fowl and seats are cramped and very uncomfortable.

228,Canada,4.0,1,porter-airlines,,Economy,,8.0,I enjoyed flying Porter out of Toronto into New York. Friendly staff and civilized service. The disappointment was flying back in foggy weather. My flight was redirected to Hamilton because the Island airport doesn't have good navigation systems for landing in fog and Porter's terminal at Pearson doesn't have Customs agents. Porter arranged buses from Hamilton to Toronto so they handled the situation well but the trip took much longer than planned. I would use Porter again for domestic flights but not rely on them for on-time arrival from the US.,,3/16/2010,,,,,A Boltwood,0,0,0
229,United Kingdom,2.0,0,air-new-zealand,,Economy,,2.0,"Heathrow to LA in Economy. This was my first and last time flying with Air NZ. Firstly the best aspect was the crew friendliness. They seem good fun and genuinely happy to help. The ones I chatted to really hate the 777-300 aircraft. One said it wasn't designed to 4 seats in middle row and she seemed genuinely sorry for the customers squashed in a middle seat. A result of having an extra seat in the middle has meant that the aisles have got narrower. I really felt sorry for the crew having to walk sideways a lot of the time. I was in an aisle seat and was constantly being bashed by the crew and passengers waking past. Clearly they are trying to squeeze out as much profit at the expense of customer comfort. I paid extra for a ""preferred seat"" and apparently this includes a row behind a leg room seat. Not sure why I had to pay extra for this seat that was no different to any other regular row. When the guy in front put his seat back I felt so claustrophobic and could hardly see my TV screen. The food was very average and I waited over 80 minutes to be served an alcoholic drink with my meal. Being offered a glass of tap water just after take-off is very poor and not what you'd expect from a very expensive ""4 star airline."" The choice of films is very limited and very few new titles.

Economy class seating meal options inflight entertainment all very reasonable but I didn't see the five star airline reputation particularly. Final leg Myanmar to Doha was overbooked and I was kicked off with nosearch for volunteers (seemingly as were a lot of other single male travellers) resulting in a 13 hour layover in Doha. Placed on a 2am flight home and Doha airport was dreadful - food appalling customer service desk rammed and understaffed the staff who were on duty were rude and nobody actually seemed to know where my luggage was. DOH-LHR I have never been treated so rudely by airline staff (told I was in the wrong area when I accidentally went to the wrong toilet).

They are having some dispute with AA so AA and Air Tahiti are refusing to let each other's business class passengers into their lounges but they don't tell you until you get to the lounge. With three small children and already on flights for 12 hours with a 6 hour stopover in LAX they refused us entry to the Lounge. The staff in the Lounge were kind. Air Tahiti wouldn't let us pay for the lounge without first going out of security again waiting 30 minutes for them to process the payment and receipts and then line up in security all over. Apparently they used to let people phone in the credit card number to avoid having to exit security but now they have decided they rather make passengers spend over an hour at their desk/security.

Inflight entertainment quite good. However there were some bad points. The meal was very poor (just the main course with appetizer and desert but no salt no pepper and other things like in other airlines) and incredibly tasteless. Plus our flight had suffered from 2 hours of delay due to airplane problem. The problem was not the delay (it may happen sometimes) as we were provided food and water but the airport staff had apparently forgotten to tell me about the delay so I discovered it a little bit late! Yet the delay had been scheduled hours before departure. However my impression is that EVA Air is a good airline with a good cabin crew.,4.0,9/17/2013,4.0,,3.0,1.0,A Bor,0,0,0

But actually they made a mistake by placing my luggage in the ""executive class passengers"" part of the arrival point.

235,Latvia,4.0,1,aeroflot-russian-airlines,,Economy,,6.0,RIX-SVO-PVG and back. From RIX to SVO it was a partner flight with Air Baltic. Then came the horror of SVO-PVG. I had no option to choose seats. I was asked in RIX while checking in for seat preference and I said aisle. I did get one for RIX-SVO and for SVO-PVG I got a 28th row which on their A330 is in front of the toilets and the seat does not recline. The seats were rather worn and entertainment system was slow though the selection of media was excellent. The food was plain insulting with 2cm of salmon sliced over some canned carrots and peas presented as a salad. The bun was hard and the choice of main course was chicken or fish for dinner and chicken or goulash for the supper. The dessert was surprisingly good though I had to wait 40 minutes for the tea to have it with while they were finishing servicing everyone. And now for the best part the service. Apparently they are split in the teams of 2 with some kind of good cop / bad cop principle as in both aisles we've seen one was making attempts to smile and the other one was plain offensive. The bathrooms were hardly cleaned the pilots announcements were hardly audible. So imagine my surprise when on the return flight from Shanghai to Moscow I was greeted by a very professional and helpful staff (still not smiling) got into a very comfortable seat of a brand new shiny 777 with plenty of room even with 3-4-3 scheme great new entertainment system with touchscreen much fresher air and the food was really delicious including a very fresh bun. The short flight SVO-RIX was also very pleasant with a nice little airbus with sufficient space a delicious chicken sandwich and soft drinks and the sweetest flight attendant. To sum it all I'd say its a real hit and miss thing with Aeroflot. Stay away from the airbus on the long flights make sure its a 777 they're great. If you're unlucky enough to get airbus steer clear of row 28. The food probably depends on where they get it. The entertainment is excellent on long flights tons of good movies TV shows and music. Do not expect a good polite service on every flight. Other than that flights were on time with great connections and very reasonably priced.,5.0,7/6/2014,1.0,,3.0,3.0,A Bor,0,0,0

The flight departed thirty minutes late but were kept well informed. The meal service was cheerful with a selection of mains. The in-seat entertainment was clunky and poorly designed and the language selection confusing to say the least.

Once on board the plane was quite dated and dirty. Entertainment system was too poor to bother with. Food was reasonably good (esp. the breakfast). Onboard service was minimal and cursory (not so much unfriendly just not particularly hospitable - compared to the Thai flight BNE to BKK it was the diametric opposite). Drinks (of all kinds) were not being served regularly but only once with dinner and there was no real selection. Overall it was reminiscent of Finnair on its Helsinki-Hong Kong flights but with an older aircraft. I would suggest avoiding this airline unless you have no other choice.,1.0,10/15/2013,2.0,,1.0,3.0,A Borodin,0,0,0
238,Canada,2.0,0,sunwing-airlines,,Economy,,4.0,Trip to Fort Lauderdale and back to Toronto on April 12 and 19th. Boarding was disorganized. We were called to board and then made to wait in line before boarding this happened in both Toronto and Fort Lauderdale. Our luggage was off loaded in Fort Lauderdale but nobody announced which of the 13 carousels it was coming down at and the signage at Fort Lauderdale doesn't indicate it for Sunwing. The Fort Lauderdale check-in happens at the west side of terminal 4 the plane is loaded from the east side of terminal 3. Yes a different terminal and the opposite side too. It's a bit of a walk but doable if you don't have much carry on. In Toronto the plane touched down early but nobody was available to guide us to the gate only a 10 minute wait to get to the gate and another 5 or so for the door to be opened. Luggage came out an hour later. Staff near the luggage carousel were unable to find out what the delay was or do anything other than apologize once the luggage did start to come out. Meals - On the way down I had a breakfast muffin. It was warm on one half cold on the other. Soggy pizza about the size of a cheque book on the way back. I guess that it costs around $3 per meal they should just pocket that money and drop this lousy food. Charge me $10 extra and give me something well prepared and tasty. I don't see how I would willingly take Sunwing again. Hopefully my future flights will have other choices available.,1.0,4/22/2015,1.0,,2.0,1.0,A Borowsky,0,0,0

244,United Kingdom,3.0,1,british-airways,,Economy,,7.0,Flew 30th March 2015 LHR-YVR return with my school on a rugby tour (27 people). Seats were reasonably comfortable and they catered to my food requests of no pork well. Enjoyed it. But the IFE was absolutely horrendous and did not meet my expectations of British Airways- outdated movies with TV shows from 3 months before. Since we were flying on a Boeing 747-400 there were more seats per aisle but this made the cabin feel quite cramped. One recommendation for them - put fewer seats per aisle! Even though there were negatives flying outbound I have to say the return was great. I had swapped seats with another boy who wanted to sit next to someone so I sat in the extra legroom seats. IFE was far better and due to having the window seat I was able to sleep for around 6 hours when I was awoke by the breakfast/snack which was decent. Food had no flavour and was quite spicy (Lentil masala) but still edible. Although my experience on BA84 was very enjoyable I heard many of my companions had to move seats because of the not working IFE. One of my coaches had ordered orange juice so the cabin crew gave it to him as they were serving but then the other one would take it away for some reason and in the end they said they had none left. He had flown with Cathay Pacific to Manila the preceding week and he said that he had enjoyed that thoroughly. One of his worst experiences of air travel especially due to him being 6'4 and rather large. Overall a decent experience but just met my expectations. To improve British Airways need to start to be able to compete with other airlines like Singapore Emirates Etihad Cathay Pacific and Qantas as there service and level of comfort has definitely taken over from BA.,2.0,4/10/2015,4.0,,4.0,4.0,A Bouzid,0,0,0

Cabin crew average we were served Chicken or Beef on a 9am flight then cabin crew disappeared after drinks service. Also had to pay for alcoholic drinks which I thought was poor for long haul. Had to call cabin crew for water during flight. Seems they serve for an hour have five hours off then serve a snack 1hr before landing. Same on return leg. Food was average. No hot towels in the morning for overnight return leg Check in at EWR was quite efficient although no one spoke just directed to a check in machine and did everything else myself.

We couldn't sit together on either leg of the trip as we didn't pay extra (£15 each each way) this was quite a big deal to us. There wasn't as much choice of movies/entertainment as the bigger airlines. Also the refreshments were pretty poor. There was only 2 complimentary coffees throughout the whole of the flight. Every other drink had to be paid for. Also I found it a bit cringey how they kept pointing out the different classes of the plane. For example telling economy customers not to pass the premium curtain under any circumstances or use their toilets. The seats are uncomfortable for long haul.

There was no one at the AirAsia departure lounge counter so I went to the check in counter and asked staff what our flight status was. I was then informed that there would be announcements. 3.00pm - no announcements. 3.49pm still no announcements. 4.17pm no announcement. 4.28pm an announcement that our flight will be delayed 1 hour. 5.35pm an announcement that the plane will not arrive until 6.05pm. 6.08pm arrival of the plane. 6.35pm boarding. 7.00pm on the flight I asked the flight attendant for my pre purchased comfort kit and was informed that they did not have any on the flight. As you can imagine after spending over 3hours waiting for the flight and being told that my comfort kit was not available I was mighty ticked. I know that there are circumstances that flight will be delayed and I understand that but the lack of communication given to customers was poor. I had heard such good things regarding AirAsia but after this and the cancelation of our Clark to Kalibo flight on the 14th of November 2013 I will be very hesitant and wary of using AirAsia again.,1.0,8/11/2014,1.0,,3.0,1.0,A Bradley,0,0,0

252,United States,4.0,1,jet-airways,,,,,The whole setup at Luton with a private security channel is very convenient and about as hassle free as an airport experience can be these days. The Luton lounge is decent enough at least on par with an average business class lounge but not nearly in the same league as the Virgin Clubhouse at Heathrow. The Newark lounge is just a partitioned area in the arrivals hall without its own bathrooms etc so left a little to be desired. Also the security at Newark is just the standard lane shared with other airlines. In flight experience was similarly a slightly mixed bag. The flight attendants were friendly but seemed rather inexperienced and the food service was not particularly impressive. But the seat provided a good level of personal comfort which is really what matters most on a long flight. It had a continuous range of adjustments from upright to various reclining angles to (almost) flat and was more than adequate for getting some good sleep. I preferred this to the more plush Virgin Upper seats where the lie-flat design offers no positions between a limited initial reclining range and being turned fully flat. Overall the airline left you with the feeling that they are not quite as slick and professional as they would like you to think as some aspects of the end to end service package seemed a little half baked and improvised.

Also in the car before my the previous flight (Sydney-London) I was delighted to receive an expletive-laden tirade across the driver's radio - apparently from one of his colleagues having a bad day.

On arrival in Sydney mine were among the last (both turning up on the carousel a full 50 minutes after landing; I do not remember the timing in London). 3) The breakfast. Scrambled eggs were dry.

It is now absolutely disgusting. The one positive is that first is now offered on American Eagle - a very minor improvement of course for a flight so short in duration. I really hope management wakes up and realizes that they are ruining what was a much better than average airline.,1.0,1/19/2015,4.0,,3.0,1.0,A Brown,0,0,0
265,Canada,0.0,0,china-southern-airlines,,Economy,,2.0,We travelled on an organized tour from Vancouver to Guangzhou and on to Saigon. The tour had an all inclusive price hence we don't know how much the actual airfare would have been. The incoming flight into Vancouver was 2 hours delayed which resulted in a 3 hours late departure to Guangzhou. We had a stopover of 5 hours in Guangzhou before our flight to Saigon. However with the 3 hour delayed departure ex Vancouver the stopover was cut to 2 hours. As it turned out it was a blessing in disguise since one cup of Coffee at the Guangzhou Airport was an astonishing US $13. As to our flight we can only say never ever again will we be flying China Southern. Asking for red wine with our meal we were given the equivalent of a thimble full when asking for a refill we were told that no more wine was available. The crew were outright rude. The food was edible but that's about it. As I said never ever again will we be traveling on China Southern.,0.0,11/7/2013,1.0,,3.0,3.0,A Brutsch,0,0,0
266,United Kingdom,4.0,1,somon-air,,Economy,,6.0,DYU to FRA: Somon Air flights are very difficult to book outside Tajikstan so although their flight times suited me I ended up booking my outbound flight to Tajikstan with Turkish Air. I did manage to book my return flight with some local help whilst in Tajikstan and was pleasantly surprised. Aircraft was a new Boeing 737-900 flight was comfortable and the cabin crew very good. There were only approx 60 passengers on the flight which is probably more to do with the problems booking rather than the quality of their service. There is no TV IFE but as most of the Somon Air flights are through the night this wasn't a problem. I wouldn't put anyone off flying with Somon Air but they really do need to offer flight booking outside Tajikstan with the major travel agents in order to be competitive.,2.0,11/14/2012,4.0,,4.0,3.0,A Bradshaw,0,0,0

Flight attendants very friendly and would give other airlines a run for their money. Helsinki-London are all economy seats however business class have the middle seat of 3 blocked out giving you a bit of extra room. Nice lounge in Helsinki. Return flight delayed out of Heathrow due to fog and with only 40 minutes between the arrival from London and next leg to Singapore. This was a bit of a worry but in the end it was not a problem as the Singapore leg waited for passengers from London to arrive. Didn't use the AVOD.

We were lucky enough to get seats 1G+J on both legs of the journey so had lots of legroom. The seat was comfortable as long as you only wanted to sit and relax but it was extremely uncomfortable for sleeping. The footrest is a complete waste of time and quite dangerous as it doesn't go up high enough and therefore pressure is on the lower leg which can't be good when you're flying for 11+ hours. The armrests were very shabby and quite loose the TV unit was also wobbly and dirty although it did work well and was responsive. Considering the plane is not very old it's starting to look quite worn and untidy it wasn't very clean on either journey. The crew on the outward journey were a bit miserable and not very forthcoming with drinks the return crew were much better although there was very little choice of drinks left and even less items to purchase onboard. Obviously we had no problems getting out of the seats in Row 1 and we couldn't guarantee getting those seats each time so unless the seats are changed I don't think I'd waste my money travelling in premium again in the future. It could be so good with just a few tweaks here and there overall ok but a little disappointed.

The cabin must be among the worst for space and comfort. If you can get the same fare with another airline then I would advise you to take it!,3.0,12/18/2014,1.0,,1.0,3.0,A Cairns,0,0,0

Because I did not book directly with Monarch I was only allowed 5 kg of luggage per person and could not print boarding passes online. Both flights were on time and the pilot was very informative. I pre-booked seats to ensure that we were able to sit together and had seats 11D and 11E on both flights. It was the same aircraft on both flights I know this because the seat pocket for seat 11E was hanging off! There was a wodge of paper hankies stuck in the emergency exit door. I am 5 ft 7 inches and the leg room was totally unacceptable only one inch between my knees and the seat in front. I now realise why in the safety demonstration we were not given instruction on the brace position was because it would be physically impossible to do so on this aircraft.

We had an efficient and friendly flight with BA from Edinburgh to Heathrow where we connected to Alitalia. The contrast between the friendly BA staff and the rather surly and unhelpful Alitalia staff was shocking. While our flight to Italy took off with a minimal delay the service was minimal with only a snack served and a murky tea. We had to transfer in Milan for a flight to Naples and pass through chaotic 'security'. I was not impressed at all with the internal Alitalia flight as the staff seemed only interested in exchanging gossip over passengers. My mother-in-law requested a glass of water and was ignored.

317,United States,1.0,0,american-airlines,,Economy,,1.0,When we arrived at the airport all of the other airlines had fairly short check-in queues American Airlines filled up their queue and had a line going 30 yards down the hallway. It seemed that their computers must have shut down because the line wasn't moving. It took us two hours to get checked-in and check our bags. We would have been late for our flight but it was delayed anyway. The delay was over an hour and once we did get on the flight the seats were the most uncomfortable I have ever experienced. Our delayed flight caused us to only have 30 minutes to catch our connecting flight- which ended up leaving 10 minutes early (I am not making this up)- meaning we missed it. They issued us tickets for the next flight 3 hours later. We had confirmed seats on the ticket and everything but when we went to board the plane our tickets got flagged as invalid and we were told by the attendant that we were actually in standby- the plane ended up being full and we were not allowed on. So at this point my wife (7 months pregnant) is about to lose it and they tell us we can possibly fly out at 9 PM that evening. We do make that flight and arrive at our destination at midnight missing our evening plans and exhausting us. Again the flight itself was awful.

We also got 22kg of luggage allowance per person which is fantastic but even better than that if there are 4 people on your booking the combined allowance is 88kg which can be distributed over 4 cases.

320,Australia,3.0,0,british-airways,,Economy,,7.0,"Flew return (LHR to LAX) on the A380. Condition of the aircraft is good as the aircraft is new. BA had first business and economy on the main deck and business premium economy and economy on the upper deck. This was good as it avoided the vast spaces which could make the cabin look like cattle class. The food service was acceptable and has not changed much (except for the smaller portion) from which I first flew with BA about 15 years ago. Service was delivered in a professional and timely manner. The downside was the seat design. BA is trying to fit a remote control video screen tray table and storage space all on the seat back. This makes the tray table and video screen far too small (back to sizes that I experienced back in the 90s). This made the travel experience felt like cattle class as the seat dimension is typical economy seat size. All other airlines have improved the travel experience by improving the economy seat design. The worst experience was on the return leg when a passenger absolutely refused to put his seat upright during the dinner service and this was after I asked him repeatedly. This resulted in my tray sloping down and the dinner tray and tray table hitting my stomach. The cabin crew just shrug me off when I asked him to ask the ""gentleman"" to put up his seat for just 10 minutes.

Check-in queues were all very short and all flights departed on time. Inflight entertainment system is on par with other major airlines and certainly better than what many US airlines offer on similar flights. Food is buy on board but as we already knew this we made other arrangements. Connection in Iceland carried out with ease only criticism is that boarding in Keflavik is rather disorganised several flights leave at the same time from one corridor and announcements are not made for any of the flights making it difficult to identify which queue is for which gate/flight.

But the two very pleasant crew members at the rear of the cabin that met us at the door were on hand to make sure everyone was in the seats that had been assigned. Because of the routing of the aircraft you do get the feel that it is a glorified bus service with nothing being served between BGI and SXM. However although the crew passed through with no service as such they were happy to get you canned drinks tea coffee and other such items. We landed in SXM (stunning views and landing) and had about 50 mins on the ground to pick up passengers before we continued on to KIN. We took off on the 2 hour 15 min flight and a full meal service was conducted with a choice of 2 entrees. Alcohol is available for a charge of $5 but all other drinks are free. The only down side is the very frustrating drop down screens that play the company promo video over the loud speaker. You really cant get away from it unless you have your head sets ready to play some music to drown it out. But be aware they only let you check in one item of baggage for the hold. even if you have a really big bag they let you take it in the cabin as there is as charge of around $25 US to check in a second bag.,,2/13/2009,,,,,A Charlesworth,0,0,0

Check in opened 3hours and 30 mins before and a new hand luggage allowance has been out in place meaning passengers where getting nervous if the there bags would be fine. Wow air fail to provide online check in making it less of an attractive option. On today's flight wow air where 20mins late arriving and boarding was chaotic. They boarded in rows but nobody listened. We took off 35 mins late and the inflight experience was the same as easyjet. We saw the northern lights which was a plus but doesn't affect the airline's performance. The flight landed 20mins late in a blizzard but the pilot did a good job and landed smoothly. The crew where chatty but professional. Once arriving in KEF the jetway failed to attach on several attempts and we waited for 30mins before we could get off. Even worse we had to wait for another 30mins for our luggage meaning we left KEF at 00.25 instead of 23.30 not good. WOW AIR need improvement to its ground services before I can recommend it.

It was quick and there where 3 check in staff. The flight was nearly full today which shows they are doing well. We have reserved seats which we did get and they did acknowledge that when we booked we had the 12kg hand luggage allowance. Boarding opened at 18.40 for the 19.40 flight and we went immediately to the gate. Boarding was chaotic as they where boarding in rows and people didn't listen causing delays. It was painful and needs to be improved lot be like the procedure at KEF. We pushed back at 20.00 (late) and we were off at 20.15. The flight was good with comfy seats with recline. The buy on board was cheap in comparison with Ryanair and the crew where professional but chatty (a good balance). We landed at 23.10 in a blizzard.

Flight took a couple of hours longer due to headwind which made an uncomfortable flight even more unpleasant. The seat I had pre-booked at extra cost would not fully recline so sleeping for part of the journey to recover from an early start was impossible. The inflight entertainment is limited you are encouraged to pay an extra £10 to be able to watch films at a time convenient to you. The inflight food is meagre. If you want water it is to be paid for. On long haul flights surely this should be free. Inflight staff spend most of their time selling food and drink and other payable options. After spending 8 hours on this flight we were then told that we would have to complete customs immigrations forms for Mexican customs but they didn't have any on board. Later we were told that someone would bring them out to the plane when we landed and given to us on debarkation. However they had run out/ We were then told we could get them in the customs hall. Arrived in the customs area to overcrowded chaos. They managed to locate some forms for us and we then had to try to complete them whilst we were walking in the queue. Another passenger in the queue told us they had the same trouble last year! I always considered Thomson to be a good company to book with. Not anymore.,1.0,2/18/2013,3.0,,2.0,1.0,A Christie,0,0,0
343,United States,5.0,1,turkish-airlines,,Economy,,10.0,I flew Turkish Airlines for the first time recently and was very impressed. I just flew shorter flights between Athens and Istanbul and Izmir and Istanbul but found the cabin crew to be professional and gracious and even on a one hour regional flight still received a meal of a whole grain roll with cheese green lettuce and tomato with some yoghurt as well. After flying United with its deathly pale iceberg lettuce and overcooked food on a long flight it was really refreshing!

344,Cyprus,3.0,1,aegean-airlines,,Economy,,5.0,LCA-ATH-BRU: Very average experience. Flying from Larnaca to Athens flight arrived on time to the destination seat space was ok food was horrible. Inflight service very average. Nobody expects anything special flying economy regarding food but what Aegean served for breakfast was beyond words. A tasteless omelette there was liquid coming out of it plus a small chocolate. The second segment of my flight from Athens to Brussels was better in leg space service and food but I find unacceptable the control they have on hand luggage. Lately they introduced the low fare tickets for people travelling with just hand luggage people of course try to benefit from this. Passengers carry in the cabin what they would otherwise have checked at the check in counters! What is happening is that people carry oversized suitcases and try to fit them in the overhead storage holders and I was really surprised to see that they allow this. I was carrying a 6 kg soft handbag which I placed in the overhead holder above my seat and the air hostess asked me if she could move it in a holder further in the other row simply to fit a big suitcase! The most positive aspect to this airline is the convenient times.,3.0,2/21/2014,2.0,,3.0,2.0,A Christodoulou,0,0,0
345,Cyprus,4.0,1,lot-polish-airlines,,Economy,,6.0,BRU-WAW-LCA 5 January 2014. Web-check-in system very easy but as usual many front seats blocked in advance even if I always try to check in online as soon as web-check-in opens. This is a night flight from Brussels to Warsaw and then in Larnaca it arrives at 02.55am (+1). Flight from Brussels left with 20 mins delay but this was not a problem as there was enough layover time in Warsaw for my connection flight to Larnaca. Arriving in Warsaw and going to the gate there was already announced 15 mins delay in boarding. It seems that most of the people don't respect the hand baggage allowance rule and also the airline itself shows much tolerance on this. I could see many people (all in economy) boarding carrying 2-3 handbags and ground staff and flying attendants saying nothing about it. This gets annoying because besides onboard safety it is the space issue in the overhead cupboards not enough space for everybody. After boarding and being seated we had to wait in the aircraft for 50 mins. Pilot informed us after 30 mins we had to wait for baggage and that is why there was a delay. In any case flight left with almost an hour delay and arrived in Larnaca at 3.25 am instead of 2.55am. Service was average (as usual LOT doesn't offer onboard meals and you have to buy your food). Food is reasonably priced. Flight attendants polite but many not very friendly. I recommend this flight mainly because of the good connections and time schedule allowing you to not waste your day flying but instead flying in the evening.,0.0,1/17/2014,3.0,,3.0,3.0,A Christodoulou,0,0,0
346,United States,1.0,0,southwest-airlines,,Economy,,,Definitely not for families as you will have to be seated separately throughout the plane. The initial airfare is low until you pay the extra fees for earlier check-in times so you get a chance to sit together. I checked in 2 hours early sat in the back seat where the cabin narrows very uncomfortable and my family was spread throughout the plane. To my surprise flight attendants got up after sitting in passenger allocated seating after everyone had boarded and joked about empty seats! This airline is a nightmare!

A baby on 16 hrs flight - not recommended. Flight departed from LAX 1.5 hr late. Basically waited on board for 1.5 hrs. Everyone had already boarded so we were in this plane for at least 17 hrs. Flight uneventful new Dreamliner is a really great airplane large windows very airy cabin. Seat is good except that not every seat has direct aisle access. Inflight Entertainment great good selection of movies TV shows. Service was attentive (above usual United average) Food was decent.

The worst thing was the temperature my partner works outdoors and will often refer to 7c as 'balmy' but on this flight we froze as did everyone else - what is that about SAA? The flight from JNB - CPT was a little better - the staff were at least a little friendly. The return flights were a little better but but the food was again totally disgusting and I am used to airline food.

I called in advance to ask if I could board early to clean his seat and if they could make an announcement regarding the allergy. I do not expect anyone to change their eating habits we just wanted to make those immediately around us aware. I was told on the phone it is up to the individual crew the day of our flight. When we boarded the plane I asked a member of the crew. She said she would check. As I was seated a flight attendant came up to me and said in a condescending tone ""It is our policy that we do not make any exceptions for those with food allergies. We cannot guarantee anything and we do not make announcements. We do not serve peanuts but other people can eat what they want."" We just informed the people directly around us and they were more than understanding. The staff were just rude in general. My mother-in-law got up to get something that fell on the floor for my daughter. The flight attendant barked at her to move. She said ""Move we are coming through with the cart."" Where is common courtesy? When they came around with the beverage cart they merely said ""Drink""? At first we gave the airline the benefit of the doubt thinking it was only this crew. On our return to PHL the crew was worse. We didn't ask them to make an announcement as we knew the response would be the same. We did however inform the flight attendant of our son's allergy. During the flight I came out of the bathroom to notice that a woman was dipping her pretzels in peanut butter. I calmly asked the flight attendant if I could move away because of the peanut butter. She looked at me and said ""What do you want me to do""? I said ""I cannot stand here with him for long."" She scoffed and said facetiously to her partner "" We need to move because this kid has an allergy."" I should also note that the company said it does not serve peanuts or peanut products on the plane: however the pretzels handed to everyone were from ""King Nuts.""

It honestly felt like I was in a train buffet car - not even a plastic cup.

We arrived at National Airport on time and the bags were very fast to come off of the carousel. The airport is very convenient to access downtown DC. Return was at BWI which is only 20 miles outside DC however traffic was a nightmare and it took almost an hour to get there. Gate agents at the airport were very friendly and efficient. Security is very smooth here and the airport is overall pleasant. Boarding was quick and the flight was operated by a 737-900ER. The seats were comfortable and no one bought the direct TV.

She was so helpful to the passengers in wheelchairs and kept everyone fully informed. The crew onboard were friendly and very attentive. Always asking customers if everything was ok and picked up trash frequently. Somehow the flight departed 40 minutes late due to there being only one operational runway in FLL.

However why is this flight scheduled to leave at the time it does (5.30 pm) and then arrive into Dublin 5.5 hours later it's fast but when you land in Ireland it's still only 11 pm in NYC. If the flight is that short and apparently it regularly is then could it not be scheduled it to arrive in Ireland the same day as it leaves NYC.

Not a full flight so we had space to move and didn't have the usual cabin baggage issues. Took the cabin crew a while to get going with inflight service but they had everything we asked for. The crew were nice if a little robotic. Plane wasn't spotless but they were in a hurry to go again so understandable (it wasn't filthy either). The flight back was packed and the airport in Palma is awful one of the warmest airports I've set foot in. The usual issues with pax and their cabin baggage while this is not the fault of the crew it should be dealt with or pax should know how to stow their luggage efficiently. It seems to rather aggravate the cabin crew that they are reduced to baggage handlers and rightly too. Otherwise there were similar crew-bots to the ones on the way over. Did everything by the book and kept the lights low for anyone who wanted to sleep. As per usual the bags took an age to arrive and this seems to be quite a regular occurrence now.

Some peoples bags were too big to be brought on board including my own and were put in the hold free. FlyBe really should stipulate how small the overhead lockers are but again it was all dealt with quite professionally. Once on board the lead purser had to start moving pax around to spread the weight more evenly which delayed take off by 20 mins.

I was pleasantly surprised to find the seats we not bad food the same as Air Canada and the flight crew great. I thought Rouge was ok after all. Then came the return flight. We got to the airport only to find the flight had been cancelled and new flight would be 2 hours late. Then three then four and here's where things went downhill. I was now not going to make my connection in Toronto back to Vancouver. I was advised by a lady who barely looked up that I was now booked on a red eye out of Toronto. I said I wouldn't fly an overnight flight and could I please book the first flight out in the morning. She said no at first but then came back and said I would have to fly coach - I said no as I had an executive ticket. She said it's an aeroplan booking and added if you had a paid for an Air Canada ticket she may have been able to help me. Flew to YYZ - went right to Air Canada relations.

381,Ireland,4.0,1,ryanair,,Economy,,8.0,"Over the past month I have been on four FR flights. The first two were short hops to the UK and back the first of which (to Manchester) the trolley service didn't even make it to me due to the short duration of the flight which I didn't really mind. The flight back from Bristol was a mess and possibly the hottest plane I've been on in quite a while. Overall the service wasn't too bad they left on time and popping cabin baggage into the hold at the last minute is a great idea really speeds up the boarding process once you're on board. Just back from Barcelona the flight over was as good as any but they ran out of certain items so one wonders what pax on the way back did for food and certain drinks and frankly the seat stays comfortable for just about the duration of the flight. Turns out I didn't have to wonder what the pax on the way back did there was barely even a bottle of water left on the plane I flew home on. The inflight service from the the back was incredibly slow which probably had something to do with the fact that the crew in this section clearly did not get along. This was maybe due to the lazy attitude of one of them who declared quite audibly that she wasn't walking back to the galley to fetch something as she ""couldn't be bothered"". I've been on a couple of FR flights in the past while where the cabin crew did not get along nor try to hide it at all which is something they could look at somehow. On the whole though I don't mind flying FR once you know what you're at and what to expect then you shouldn't have a major issue.",,4/22/2015,3.0,,2.0,3.0,A Clarke,0,0,0
382,Ireland,4.0,1,ryanair,,Economy,,7.0,A return trip from Dublin to Malaga for a friends wedding the flight over left slightly late due chaotic boarding by the pax who seemed rather clueless as to what to do once you board a plane so you can't blame Ryanair for that. As per my last flights on FR they ran out of food and drink items and had a very limited selection and the service by a crew with a combined age of about 17 were slow and one rather got the impression that the four of them had just qualified the previous afternoon. They seemed stressed by the whole process and were again slow from the aft galley which is a surprise considering the lack of items they could possibly sell. There was a minor medical emergency where a pax fainted but they were quick and very attentive to deal with the situation. The flight back was again bereft of items from to purchase which was odd given that the plane was sitting on the ground the whole time I was at the gate before boarding (over an hour) but then even when you want to purchase something it's a bit of a guessing game due to the fact there are no menus. Anyway the flight began boarding early so early there were neither flight nor cabin crew on board. The flight itself was an awful experience due to being surrounded by children who took to screaming the majority of the time while their parents looked like they wanted to chuck themselves out the window. If I thought that the front of the cabin were an adults only area I would have paid anything to sit there maybe something to think about? All-in-all Ryanair are fine and are improving but it wouldn't be any harm to send mystery shoppers and auditors on flights occasionally to see what is really going on and realistically running out of the toilet paper hand towels. hand soap and saleable things like water is fairly unacceptable from a pax perspective.,,5/13/2015,2.0,,2.0,3.0,A Clarke,0,0,0

Being a very frequent traveller on Qatar Singapore Emirates I decided to give CS a go as their business class flights were very affordable. I think where they fail is what they offer to make your inflight experience more enjoyable. It's always the little things. Champagne offering cocktail offerings even food offerings! There were only 10 of us in the business class cabin and I was 3rd to place the food order yet they had already ran out choice. Their wine list is very short but was okay the teeny glasses they give aren't very nice though I think they are scared they will run out! The snacks on board was only a sandwich. Although the cabin crew gave great service their presence in the cabin wasn't that great there were quite a few stamping through the cabin to go to the galley past first class (or at least that's where I think they were going and not to sleep in the cabin! Entertainment on the flight was rubbish this is the biggest let down. The selection and choices of movies are very limited! Also they were very old.

The response (in an aggressive tone) was no! If you want to sit there its now been designated premium economy its an extra USD 170 each and you can pay by credit card! Note that this in the economy / coach section. The stewardess then made a big deal of slamming down all the dining trays on those seats as if to ""seal off the section"" - it all made for an incredibly unpleasant start to the flight. Aside from the small seats and lack of leg room when dinner came round I politely requested a cup of tea. The cup of tea was passed to me without any milk or sugar. I politely asked for milk and sugar. She stopped - glared at me and snapped - ""well you could have told me that when you asked for the tea"". By this stage me and the family I was sharing the row with were finding the staff so rude it was verging on comical. Then to top it off having spent thousands of dollars on this flight I learn that there is no free alcohol.

This makes travel with RAM impossible if you have a connection with a different airline. While travelling to Paris my husband and I had made separate reservations. For some reason he was told on a Monday that his Saturday flight had been cancelled. I was not alerted until Thursday that the same flight had been cancelled. My mother recently flew from JFK to Casablanca. It took her friend 2 hours after landing to receive her baggage. My mother's baggage was left behind in NY. We were told to call back the next day when the suitcase should have arrived on a flight coming in at 8am. The next day I called three times hours after the flight had arrived and was told that they could not confirm that the suitcase had come in. One customer service woman refused to let me speak to her supervisor and hung up on me! We ended up paying a 50$ taxi fare to go to the airport and were told to look for the suitcase ourselves by two employees who were sitting and gossiping and playing with their cell phones. Finally we found an employee in a back office who was willing to do his job. He went to another part of the airport and returned with the suitcase.

Do not choose the emergency exit seats because they do not have access to windows and are narrower because the table and the monitor are on the armrest. JNB-LHR. 747-400. It is a much older plane.

417,Canada,2.0,0,air-canada-rouge,,Economy,,3.0,"We flew Air Canada 2 weeks ago (not Rouge) Toronto - Munich on an outbound leg to Athens. While boarding the craft in Toronto was a little disorganized the flight and service was great and the flight would have rated full stars across the board. Our return flight was AC 1901 Athens-Toronto only gets 3 stars for satisfaction as we did arrive safely and on time. That is really the only good thing to be said for it. This was an 11 hour flight through 7 times zones. The flight was half full so staff were not overworked. Unless you pushed the call attendant light they were only in evidence when the very poor meals were delivered (not served). No choice available limited beverage service followed 15 minutes later. One mid-flight trip down the aisle to slide some pretzels and 4 ounces of pop or juice onto your tray and two silent passes of an attendant with a bottle of water and the staff disappeared at least in our cabin. No entertainment available at the seat unless you were willing to pull out a credit card again to rent the airline tablet. The worst of it all was the total lack of comfort provided by the seat. We do not like having the seats in front of us recline so that is not really a problem however the seat design offers no support in the lower back and has restricted both aisle and window passengers from stretching their legs. The arm rest design means that you can inadvertently call the attendant or turn your light on or off. Others have commented on the lack of personal ventilation at the seat so I won't. A mixed blessing was having blankets and pillows provided prior to take-off. At 1pm this seemed a little like telling someone that they are being ""put down for a nap"". If you don't want them you must give up your limited space to store the items in the event that might want them. On the plus side overhead baggage storage was adequate (however this was not a full flight and might be a problem if fully loaded). Washrooms were adequate but masking tape holding dispensers and bins closed does not inspire confidence. As has become the norm the audio system was poor - either the airline staff need a lesson in microphone use and diction or the system needs an overhaul as most announcements were so ""mushy"" as to be indecipherable. Finally while we recognize that the airport is responsible at this point the baggage pick-up was a bit of a problem as the overhead monitors specified one carousel but the baggage actually arrived on a different one.",1.0,6/12/2014,1.0,,1.0,1.0,A Cowan,0,0,0

It is basically impossible to speak to anyone who knows what they are doing or that has access to necessary information. Three times now I have attempted to book (either during reservation or after) bassinet row seats or biz upgrade only to be told that it is all full up and not possible. You get to the flight and find empty seats. Furthermore they want to sell the bulkhead seats for 45 euros but will not prioritise for people with young children. So first come first served basically.

On the AUH to MAN flight the cabin staff gave our vegetarian meal to the family behind us.

They even boarded us and we taxied out to take off but they found yet another mechanical fault while we were on the runway. Returned and disembarked. Very rude ground crew. Flight then cancelled. Had to wait in a long line to be put on a new flight. Cabin crew from other flights dame and pushed in at the top of the line making our wait even longer! Could not believe how rude they were. Even though Philadelphia is a hub for them and the flight was fully booked they could not find an alternative aircraft. And lots seemed to be sitting around going nowhere. We took a flight to Boston. Very rude woman at the gate looked at my BA Silver card and yelled - You are not preferred customers! She did not even know who US Airways partner airlines are. We arrived in Boston on a plane with broken toilets. None working in Economy. There is always something broken on a US Airways plane. Our bags were sent to Bagnor. So we had to spend a night sleeping in our clothes and then drive out of our way to Bangor airport to collect them next day. I have never had a flight with this airline where the plane took off on time and everything on board worked. Many flights were cancelled. Even long distance ones from London.

469,Canada,3.0,0,united-airlines,,Economy,,1.0,"This review relates to a 5 flight itinerary booked with United. Other than flight segment 3 which was with Lufthansa from Barcelona (BCN) to Munich (MUC) the other 4 flights were with United Airlines. The problem started when United had a schedule change which did not allow us a legal connection in Newark (EWR) on the outbound flight to Barcelona (BCN). We received an e-mail from United informing us of a change in time to an earlier flight from Phoenix (PHX) to Newark (EWR) allowing us a legal connection for our flight. This in itself was a bit annoying since we went from an original connection time of one hour to a four hour connection. Unfortunately we ""accepted"" the change on-line which was the first error on our part. The day prior to departing from Phoenix we received the usual message telling us we could print our boarding passes. This worked fine until we checked the boarding passes only to find out there was no longer the priority boarding we had booked and paid for. This resulted in spending over an hour on the phone to United. As it turned out with every segment flown with United it was necessary to go through the whole process of having them reprint boarding passes which showed the priority boarding and then only after we had provided them with proof this had been purchased. As for the flights themselves? The usual experience of dealing with disinterested flight attendants barely edible food and the fact as I was told ""United no longer offers special meals (eg: low cholesterol or diabetic) but does provide a kosher meal for its Jewish and Muslim passengers and a beef free meal for its Sikh passengers. So all in all the poor service of United Airlines appears to be the norm more and more these days rather than the exception which really is a problem for the UA's promise that we are ""flying the friendly skies"".",3.0,2/20/2014,1.0,,3.0,1.0,A Davidson,0,0,0

It must have become all too much for three of the crew as they decided to take a seats in row one for 20/25 minutes taking about their children. Just before landing one of the crew members did the most pathetic congratulation to a just married couple I have ever heard she even put the tannoy down before finishing the sentence.

After hours on the phone I was rebooked to a flight the next day.

474,Canada,3.0,1,vueling-airlines,,Economy,,7.0,"Flight 3000 - Barcelona (BCN) to Las Palmas (LPA) taken on Jan 31st 2014. In general we were more than satisfied with the flight itself which actually left the ""gate"" (a spot where the plane was parked on the tarmac) a few minutes ahead of schedule. On boarding the aircraft we proceeded to store out luggage in the overhead bin above our seats in row 3 only to be promptly told this bin was for ""Excellence"" guests (ie: those sitting in row 1 of the aircraft) and that we would have to move our carry on back to the next bin. Funny thing was no one sat in row 1 on this flight so the whole exercise was a bit stupid. The aircraft itself was in the Iberia livery as Vueling appears to be a subsidiary of Iberia. An older Airbus 319 it was obviously in need of a bit of tender loving care. The seats we were seated in sagged almost to the floor which provided for a rather uncomfortable four hour ride to say the least. Furthermore the aircraft had not been groomed prior to our boarding and as a result we found used tissues stuffed in with the flight safety card and magazines. Not a great start. The on-board service was no more than satisfactory to say the least and we will leave it at that.

On the outward flight we were seated in cattle class at the back with legroom fit for a dwarf like Mr Moss the cabin crew came round with hot drinks etc without being informed there was a hot meal being provided later luckily we had a hot drink/snack because I could not fold my tray down because of the lack of room. Coming home we booked seats at the front with extra legroom. On arrival at Hurghada airport we were all given a letter telling us we were being diverted to Rome as the plane would encounter very strong headwinds and was incapable of holding enough fuel to get us back to the UK. Had a good flight up to Rome just over 4 hrs with a nice meal on a tray that we were able to fold down with comfort - paying £40 a couple for the extra legroom. Then informed by the captain that once we landed in Rome there was a standby crew that had been flown from Gatwick waiting for us - Monarch must have known well in advance this was going to happen. Less than 30 mins later we all got back on - the new captain then informed us we would have to get off again because there had been a mess up with the amount of fuel.

The flights in both directions were reasonably good the entertainment systems were broken for most of the seats but staff were pleasant and helpful and food was good. Unfortunately the reaction to the cancelled flight was awful and the worst treatment I have ever received from an airline. As the previous reviewer says the staff were very slow extremely ill informed and seem to have lied on occasion. Almost no effort was made to inform passengers as to what they needed to do in terms of changing flights getting back through immigration control and sorting out a hotel. This resulted in a great deal of frustration and wasted time queuing in the wrong places. In particular the airline made very little effort to help passengers find hotel accommodation; only one member of staff was available to help and passengers including us were told that there was no hotel accommodation left available which was later proved to be untrue when a number of passengers complained and were miraculously found hotel rooms. I suspect the lack of hotel rooms may have related rather more to a lack of appetite to pay the room rates rather than any genuine shortage. Ultimately we along with perhaps a third of the passengers ended up sleeping on the floor of the transit lounge until we were told to get up and move at around 6am. The re-scheduled flight was then further delayed when the first officer did not turn up for work at this point refreshments were provided but not enough for all the passengers.

The flights to and from Cancuun consisted of rude staff poor service and horrible food. When we arrived in Cancun it took SunWing 2 hours to arrange our transfer from the airport to our hotel leaving us and a number of other guests who had young children standing on the curb for that time. Our return flight originating in Cancun was a disaster. During check-in the agent informed us that we were over our baggage limit which was not possible as we were returning with the same bags with which we had arrived (no additional weight). When we explained to them at length that we had purchased an extra baggage allowance and showed the receipt they replied we did not that we only had advanced seat selection and early boarding with our additional purchase. This was not the story we got either from the agent when booking or at the Calgary airport agent during check in. They both stated that the package we bought included extra baggage. We ended up having to explain ourselves to the check in agent the manager and another customer service rep but to no avail. We were told the only way we would be able to take our bags home was to pay an additional $100 or to take our bags and leave. We were given two options: either pay for the additional baggage or take our bags and leave. Of course we ended up paying the baggage fee of $100 but we left feeling very disappointed in our choice of booking on SunWing especially when we had other choices for this trip. We had made our decision to book with SunWing based in part on the additional baggage we would be allowed but it is clear that the additional baggage offering is not what it appears to be. We will never book with Sunwing again and advise others to find other vacation providers. We travel frequently and have had some great experiences and some mediocre experiences nothing we couldn't live with.

For the first trip (Zanzibar via Dar es Salam to Kilimanjaro) we got up at 4.45 am to get our early flight. After waiting for a long time at the airport we heard our flight at 7.40 am was cancelled and that we were put on the next flight from 12.10 pm.… Not a very nice message to convey to 3 young kids who are looking forward to starting a safari adventure. According to our original schedule we would arrive in Kili at 11am according to our new schedule at 17.00hrs! As compensation we were each given a bottle of cola. The transfer time in Dar would have been more than sufficient for a copious lunch however the terminal the national flights only has one small snack bar. Anyway this is Africa so you cannot expect too much in addition we were on holidays so we spend some money in the airport bookshop and patiently waited. After some very unclear messages via the intercom our patience was challenged again: Our flight to Kili was delayed. Total confusion in the lounge as it was unclear until when it was delayed. I went to the ground staff and told our story of getting up at 4:45am and the fact that almost 12 hrs later we were still in Dar. She then told me that she was surprised that we were on the 7.40 flight as this flight had been non-existent for 3 months. How could we have reserved it on the Precision website less than 3 months ago? Eventually we got there. If you have to fly with Precision prepare for the massive disconnect between the attitude of ground and flight staff and the Precision slogan: ”you are why we fly”.

Had to collect bag from baggage claim when I got to Philadelphia but at least I didn't have to pay for it.

Seated and then given a guided tour of all the facilities and features.

I had pre-ordered multigrain toast after a few mis-understandings on what it came with I decided to stay with this choice however I wish I had not. It consisted of 2 pieces of what was more like chipboard than toast accompanied by grilled asparagus carrots aubergine and courgettes and on the same place was a sweet pastry.

510,United States,1.0,0,spirit-airlines,,,,1.0,"Spirit Airlines is the worst airline we have ever traveled on. This was our first and will definitely be our last time we will ever travel with them. You have to pay for everything; seat assignment Carry-on bag checked bags; any drinks or snacks on board. No complementary water no free coffee no free soft drinks. Everything has a price. I'm surprised they don't charge to use the toilet? If you don't prepay for your carry-on bag on-line you get charged $100.00 for it at the terminal. We saw several people discover that when they were in line to board the plane –needless to say they were very upset! There is basically no leg room at all. I am about 5’-8” (short by today’s standards) and I had only about 2 inches of room between my knees and the seat back in front of me. On 3 out of the 4 of the planes we traveled on the seat-backs were locked in one fixed position with no adjustments available -– great for ones back on flights of over 3 and 4 hours particularly for seniors? Or outgoing flight from Oakland CA went smoothly until we got to Chicago IL for our connecting flight to Ft. Lauderdale. We had flight delay of over 3 hours and finally arrived at our destination in Ft. Lauderdale FL at 1:00 am too late for the free shuttle to our hotel. It cost us $50.00 to get another shuttle. If you don't down-load your boarding pass on-line you have to pay extra for it at the terminal. After downloading your boarding passes on-line the heading of your boarding pass states ""Congratulation! You are eligible for Fast Bag Drop"" Then it goes on to state that customers wanting to check bags must do so 45 minutes prior to scheduled departure time. n our return flight from Ft. Lauderdale FL our shuttle dropped us off at the terminal with 1 hr. 15 min. to spare before our scheduled flight. The problem with that is when you arrive at the counter for ""Fast Bag Drop"" there was only one agent handling that and the line was like a Disney World line waiting for a popular ride. There were about 6 other agents waiting patiently for customers who had to pay for their checked bags; carry-on bag and boarding passes. My wife and I who are over 70 year old seniors attempted to use one of these ""observing agents"" to give them our bags and was directed to get back in the long curving line. I questioned where the “Fast Bag Drop” is and was totally ignored. Spirit should rename it to “Snail Pace Bag Drop” which would be far more appropriate! On 2 of our 4 flights we had to listen to an annoying lengthy sales pitch by the flight attendants who were attempting to get customers to sign up for Spirit’s frequent flyer Master Card. I should point out that two positive things about Spirit Airlines are that the flight attendants were mostly friendly and polite and our checked bags arrived safely with us at our destinations.

525,Greece,4.0,1,aegean-airlines,,Economy,,9.0,ATH-LHR A321 new and clean . Sat in row 4A perhaps too far front as the you cant see the TV screen at all due to the fact it is placed on the Business Class Divider (first 3 rows are business class). Flight well priced and I like the fact that their tickets are changable by paying a small fee. The food was fine but portions were too small. Asked for a second meal which was provided after 5 minutes. The luggage collection landing in Heathrow was too slow and took forever. Despite these small issues Aegean Airlines is an airline that I enjoy flying with and the best choice by far out of Athens.,,5/23/2011,,,,,A Douas,0,0,0
526,Greece,5.0,1,pegasus-airlines,,Economy,,10.0,ATH-SAW-ESB. Pegasus is half the price of THY for this route so I prefer flying for them for 2 flights that last no more than 1 hour each. Since the flight is so short I never bother with the overpriced food and drink. Seats are fine flight attendants don't bother you unless necessary for safety or if you want something to eat. 20 kg free luggage allowance is better than most legacy carriers!

527,United States,2.0,0,southwest-airlines,,Economy,,2.0,Our first and last time using Southwest. We flew from New York (LGA) to Chicago (MDW) over the Labor Day weekend. Outbound trip was ok but the return was chaotic. Our return flight was scheduled for an 8pm departure but was delayed to 11pm due to some weather issues which we can understand. However they kept changing the departure status from 11pm to 10.30pm to 9.10pm and then to 9.45pm. When they changed it to 9.10pm this was when we had to scramble to the airport. We managed to make it to Midway but we were scattered on the plane even when we had Boarding group A.

529,Thailand,1.0,0,china-airlines,,Business Class,,5.0,Taipei to Vancouver in Business Class. No alcoholic welcome drinks offered upon boarding only water and juice. They were quick to announce that since this was a late evening departure they would be serving only a light meal - but since it was only 11pm I felt this a bit of a cheap excuse since the flight is nearly 12 hours in duration. Even after take-off I had to ask for a drink as it became evident they weren't going to offer any before the light meal - of which there only two choices (one Asian and one sort-of Western) - wine was ok. As far as I could tell there was no service between meals - not even water trips - though they did hand out small bottles early on. Contrary to other suggestions here and elsewhere this route does not have angled beds in J/C Class - only the old z-style recliner seat. AVOD was pretty good - with a decent selection of both movies and music - didn't go back to Y section so not sure what was available there. Biz class seat was a bit cheaper than others flying the route - but to be honest I would have been much better of flying Cathay in Y class and saving the difference.,,8/21/2010,,,,,A Dow,0,0,0
530,United Kingdom,2.0,0,thomas-cook-airlines,,Economy,,4.0,Travelled to Cancun from Manchester on 28th January 2015. Several weeks prior to travel we were contacted by TC Airlines to be informed that the newly refurbished aircraft would be unavailable for this outbound flight no personal seat back screens but overhead screens instead and less leg room. A refund of £25 was given. Another week later another call the same happened for the inbound flight. The aircraft was quite shabby seat backs wonky causing trays not to be level. in-flight entertainment dismal that's when you could see a screen that worked correctly (PC tablets a must for own entertainment). Food was reasonable. The reason for booking with TC was the direct flights and the newly refurbished aircraft. Having travelled previously with Thomas Cook to the Canary Islands I was reluctant to travel long haul with them well next time I will travel non-direct just to avoid this pathetic excuse of an airline.,1.0,3/4/2015,3.0,,2.0,4.0,A Draper,0,0,0

The poor service include having to ask for most things and not being offered anything (like drinks) more than once several mistakes on the breakfast order non-availability of several food items on the menus generally morose staff etc etc. This was really poor TAM - you are letting your country down and you need to get your act together with the Olympics looming fast!,4.0,5/20/2015,1.0,,3.0,1.0,A Driver,0,0,0

Drinks (including decent Romanian wine) available to purchase and staff seemed friendly. On return route there seemed to be wider selection of sandwiches and snacks on offer. Return flight delayed by 30 minutes with no explanation given (at least not in English).

Staff professional handed out drinks and sandwiches (which were adequate but which could perhaps be upgraded slightly from slightly skimpy cheese or tuna mayonnaise). The basket of complimentary Belgan chocolate squares passed round later is a nice touch though. Return flight check-in handled by Air France at Florence. For some reason AF staff insisted that queuing passengers should print out their boarding cards from automated check-ins before dropping baggage. Flight similarly smooth although delayed by about 20 minutes due to late incoming aircraft for which captain apologised. Cabin crew made a second sandwich run offering more to anyone who wanted them.

Boeing 777 with 10-abreast economy cabin which felt cramped. Legroom just about bearable - I'm 1.82m and my knees were touching the magazine pocket of the seat in front (pocket seemed to jut out considerably which had noticeably detrimental effect on legroom). Meals served soon after take-off on both flights and were quite skimpy but perhaps no bad thing so late at night. Cabin crew retired to galley after meal service and were not obvious until breakfast. Variety on IFE was limited but there were some reasonably modern films that passed the time. In all a very average (and somewhat tedious) 11-hour flight.,3.0,3/25/2013,3.0,,3.0,3.0,A Dron,0,0,0
537,South Africa,4.0,1,south-african-airways,,Economy,,7.0,I am currently in Entebbe (Uganda) and awaiting to board the delayed flight SA161 to JNB. It was scheduled to take off at 07.25 in Uganda but we have been informed that it will only take off by 10am today (25 May 2013). My concern is that I have a connection flight to PE scheduled to take off from JNB by 13.10pm (SA417). My incoming flight will then literally arrive minutes before SA417 will depart for PE. I am therefore looking forward in anticipation to see how SAA will deal with and co-ordinate linking myself up with the flight to PE later today. If SAA can pull this one off without a passenger having to be inconvenienced it will be great.

538,United Kingdom,4.0,1,saudi-arabian-airlines,,Economy,,7.0,Heathrow - Jeddah - Riyadh - Heathrow. Check-in at LHR for lunchtime departure was instant - no queue. Boeing 777 2x5x2 seating. Comfortable seats decent legroom economy about half- full. Newspapers offered (mainly Arabic) followed by soft drinks. Typical airline food. Seatback screen but not AVOD - system had to be re-set twice by cabin crew early on but otherwise no problems. Flight smooth with the exception of a couple of Arab children running repeatedly up the aisles - fairly normal on MidEast airlines where parents rarely discipline their offspring. Major stroke of luck on arrival at Jeddah as I was attending a conference for which Saudia was handling many of the arrangements so whisked through VIP lounge passport stamped and into a taxi within 20 minutes of getting off aircraft. Jeddah-Riyadh again a 777 an 80-minute hop. Aircraft packed which made the serving of a full breakfast particularly impressive : full marks to the cabin crew. Not a lot of smiles from them but understandable when concentrating on serving 300 people in such a short time. Riyadh-LHR another 777 but this time 10-abreast (3-4-3) and seats noticeably thinner and less comfortable. Felt as though there was around an inch less legroom too which made an appreciable difference. Cabin crew helpful: one FA volunteered that my seatback screen was not working and offered to re-seat me. Only problem was again children running around and one little girl was actually standing on her seat as take-off started. Toilets acceptable. In all a series of flights I would rate as better than average and around 30% cheaper than British Airways.,,10/23/2009,,,,,A Dron,0,0,0

Onboard: the new Flat Bed was announced it was an Old Style Business Class maybe ex BMI Aircraft with roomy comfortable Business Seats but with a dirty old look. Terrible non AVOD TV and Audio Program and not the promised full flat seat. Very good first class style dinner and breakfast. 4 flight attendants have to serve a maximum of 18 seats but no one knows what the other one is doing. They walk back to the galley for every single plate and glass which is very confusing for them and the passengers. Anyway very friendly crew and excellent meals served. 30 minutes late departure in Colombo 20 minutes late arrival in Frankfurt.

We were extremely annoyed that we had to spend a 14 and a half hour flight sitting in between strangers when we booked to sit together. There was no complimentary alcoholic beverages and the good food always ran out by the time it got towards the end of the plane which a lot of people complained about to the staff.

After investigating other similar flights AtlasJet (Atlas Global) were about half the price of Turkish Airlines. AtlasJet only fly from London Luton which is a massive bonus for us as we live only 10 miles away from Luton. Our check in and security at London Luton was very quick and easy. Check in etc at Istanbul was harder due to the fact that Turkey have a double screening procedure (Security when just enter the Airport and extra security through to the departures lounge after your check in). Both flights took off a bit late (only 15-20 minutes) but both flights arrived on time. Flight times we thought were excellent with a noon departure to Istanbul and 9am Departure to London Luton. Our outward flight to Istanbul was full but the homeward bound flight to London Luton was less than half full and passengers were allowed to spread out after take-off to either sleep or relax more. We were also served a good quality hot meal which included Turkish wine and beer at no extra cost and the female flying chef who served Turkish cakes near the end of the flight that she had made on board was different and a good U.S.P when compared to other flight carriers.

558,Thailand,5.0,1,oman-air,,Economy,,10.0,BKK-MCT-MUC return. Flight to Muscat was about half full so plenty of room to stretch out. Entertainment was fine and watched a new movie and several TV shows. Economy class seating was spacious in a 2x4x2 configuration. Food was average and not much of it but wine was plentiful. Hot wrap snack before arrival into Muscat was just ok. Muscat airport has no jetways so buses are involved. Both sectors took no more than 10 minutes total and was well organized. The airport was fine though the Duty Free seemed overly expensive but there are several decent food outlets including Costa Coffee. Flight to Munich again was half empty so we could stretch out but once again the food was just average though they gave us several bottles of wine and water. Return flight from Munich to Muscat had 42 passengers total on the flight. We were the only ones in the front economy class cabin and were served within 10 minutes after take off and lights out 30 minutes later which was great as the flight leaves at 10pm. Slept 5 hours straight as we made beds from the middle section with many blankets and pillows. Better than first class! Flight from Muscat to Bangkok was 100pct full so I was now wondering what the service would be like. We had 2 seats together at the window in 2nd cabin with no room to stretch out but again the seating is great and the best economy class at 34 inches I've been in. Service was efficient and quick even with a full flight. All sectors the cabin crew were friendly and welcoming. Nice towel service all flights and good amenities kits handed out on each sector. Entertainment is fine and no issues and could recharge my phone and laptop as well from any seat. My only issue was the food. Little of it and not very appetizing though on one sector the vegetarian lasagne was good. Water bottles were also handed out immediately after service on all sectors which is a great idea. If I was not Gold with Etihad I would fly them again though you do get Etihad mileage by flying Oman but just not the bonus miles for Gold or Silver level.

559,United States,3.0,0,united-airlines,,Economy,,1.0,We have flown with a number of other airlines both internationally and domestic and flying United was a nightmare. Weather is out of everyone's control but management of the overall system is a disaster and not equipped on the front line to deal with flight problems. We normally fly in and out of MSP but United ORD on the surface offered better options for connections to and from Toronto. The problems in Chicago from what information we managed to get (mostly from other passengers both on our flight and other flights) were they did not know where aircraft crews were where the planes were coming and going or what gate (we were moved 3 times-one of which was on the opposite end of the terminal). We have had less delays and problems flying out of MSP in brutal winter weather. They make no announcements and changes are not posted timely and if you can't get an audience with very limited counter agents you find out your flight has been cancelled when the boarding time has come and gone. We witnessed that time and again. We were rebooked on the same flight 24 hours later-and as expected no luggage when we arrived-the tracking showed the time and place it was checked in more than 24 hours earlier at ORD-no progress up the chain in over 24 hours. I honestly feel for the counter people who have to deal with the chaos and irate passengers with little information and resources to fix problems-no wonder they may be less than friendly at times. I do believe there are huge and unnecessary internal problems with this airline (or airport) because we have flown from coast to coast foreign countries and very bad weather with other airlines (and airports) that managed to deal with flight problems in a more efficient and passenger friendly manner. Who cares about the free soda with no ice - it would appear United-ORD has much much bigger problems.,1.0,6/25/2014,2.0,,3.0,1.0,A Ehmen Carlotta,0,0,0

I find the check in system in ARN slightly confusing but ground staff were lovely and helped out. On board however it was an entirely different story. Stony faced cold unwelcoming cabin crew all but one of which didn't at all smile. Seats were hard and uncomfortable. I had less legroom than on a Ryanair flight which for a full service airline and more importantly a full service price. Also there was no food offered only cups of water. Everything else was a buy on board service which for a full service airline is just disgraceful.

561,Ireland,2.0,0,sas-scandinavian-airlines,,Economy,,4.0,Flew with SAS from DUB to CPH a week ago. Check-in was easy and smooth and the flight left on time. However from there on things got disappointing. Since the flight was the most expensive one I expected better service than LCC level buy-on-board service which was offered. Also seat comfort was terrible due to the aircraft having those awful Recaro Slimline Seats which are possibly the most uncomfortable things in the sky. Even Ryanair is better than this and they charge a reasonable fare unlike SAS. This is poor value for money. This really lets them down as their crews are very friendly and helpful. What also lets them down is their chaotic hub at CPH. Arriving and departing passengers are not separated and therefore it is a bit difficult to find the baggage reclaim area and it takes a long time to get there. Furthermore the airport is clearly understaffed as we were stuck in the queue at immigration for 15 minutes + which is unacceptable given that the airport had only 1 out of 4 passport control booths open at the time. I would fly SAS again but only if they are cheaper than any other option because the value for money is poor and the comfort is poor.,1.0,8/26/2014,5.0,,1.0,1.0,A Elliott,0,0,0

The plane has the worst leg room your could imagine. My farther had to stand up for the whole flight as the leg room was uncomfortable to sit in. The attitude of the crew was very bad as they were rude and looked like they had a sour face at the passengers. Although on the way back to Doncaster the crew were not as bad and were polite. The captain never said anything to the passengers like saying thank you for flying or coming out at the end of the flight to say in person.

565,United States,1.0,0,spirit-airlines,,Economy,,1.0,This airline is the worst! As I'm typing this review I'm sitting in an airport waiting on a delayed flight. It was Spirits first flight of the day from PHL to Myrtle Beach and the weather is perfect for a Labor Day weekend so one would not think a flight would be delayed. The reason for the delay is that the flight staff got in really late last night so in order to stay in compliance with the employment rules they must rest. I completely understand that but instead of Spirit sending the passengers an email/text because they had advance notice of this delay they just let people show up at the crack of dawn for nothing! Any savings you get from purchasing a Spirit ticket will be offset by extra fees (extra time spent for parking in the garage seat fees baggage fees and tons of indirect fees) lost time (I could've slept in) headaches and bad customer service.

Be careful to read everything before you book because they charge extra to reserve a seat which by the way are uncomfortable and do not even recline. With the exception of 1 employee that I encountered they are not friendly people. None of the flight attendants seemed to like their jobs. None of the employees seem to know their jobs. Our flight departed 3 hours late. Then when the plane couldn't land at our destination because of bad weather they took us to another destination. OK anyone that has flown understands that these things happen. But the attitudes of the workers and the lack of communication made this a horrible experience. We were stranded for almost 7 hours after we were told that ground transportation was being supplied to get us to our destination. What should have been a 3-hour trip turned into an 18-hour ordeal.

They downgraded their product to Hong Kong (in economy there are two or three fewer washrooms for 100 more passengers line ups a mile long the toilets are backing up as they are not designed for this volume of passengers. I have never in all my years heard more angry passengers than the Honk Kong to Vancouver AC passengers in any class. For a crass money grab on these routes AC is risking a big revenue loss to Japan airlines Cathay and other Asian airlines and on Europe runs to British Air and others even Lufthansa. This high density move is a complete disaster on the 777's and AC should reconsider.

582,United Kingdom,1.0,0,ryanair,,Economy,,1.0,Flew Manchester-Gran Canaria. Good flight times and got baggage quickly. Attempting to print off the boarding pass scam was painful to say the least. In the UK the site kept crashing and took the best part of a day to achieve the process only to have to repeat this in our holiday destination. When at Manchester airport it was displayed that boarding for our flight was in 5 minutes this continued for about 25 minutes with no updates. We were then requested to proceed to boarding that I can only explain as a cattle market. We were then left to wait in the queue for the best part of another 45 minutes. Consequently our flight was delayed by well over an hour with no explanation or apology. Whilst on the flight to Gran Canaria the seat belt sign light was displayed intermittently for long periods with no evidence of turbulence or explanation. Being 2 adults we could manage this but we had to feel for the passengers with young children who desperately wanted the toilet. Baggage - the allowance is 15 kilos for hold luggage and 10 for hand luggage. When we flew out from Manchester they counted hand luggage in our allowance. On return from Gran Canaria they decided that hold luggage should only be 15 kilos. Our hold luggage weighed exactly the same as it did at Manchester and we did not have hand luggage but were told that it would cost us 70 euros to pay the excess. Having very little hand luggage facilities available we had to empty our case to avoid the excess charge. Admittedly we should have read the small print but one would question why this was not highlighted in Manchester and came to light in Gran Canaria on our return.

The only long haul airline I have flown in the last 5 years where in Economy you do not get any inflight entertainment system. All you get is films on a loop. I had to wait 20mins for the loop to start again. Flew LHR-SFO last October and on the EWR-LHR route this time the same film selection was playing as in October. Particularly galling as I paid a cheaper price for a trip to Thailand on Thai Airways last year and the IFE was excellent. Staff whilst pleasant are genuinely uninterested took 10 mins to answer my call to ask them to get my bag out of the overhead locker as the passengers either side of me were asleep. You have to pay for the alcoholic beverages - $7 for a 125ml bottle of red wine is an unbelievable rip off. The seat was the most uncomfortable seat I have sat in with the exception of Ryanair where you expect an uncomfortable ride. On the plus side there is an extremely good availability of economy plus seats and the legroom really is superb in these seats but this does not make up for the overall comfort of the seat.

597,United Kingdom,3.0,0,gulf-air,,Business Class,,3.0,LHR to Kabul return. Outbound excellent check-in and very impressive Gulf Air lounge. Onboard A330 seating was ok but short of offerings by their Gulf based competitors. A good menu available well presented and tasty with a good selection of wines and other beverages. Rather than the installed IFE C class passengers were given standalone equipment which had a fair range of viewing options. Transit in Bahrain was fine lounge had a great view over the apron and friendly staff but furnishings very tired and early morning food offerings not the best. Connecting flight on A320 C class had 2-2 configuration. Meal served was fair alcoholic drinks only available on request. Return was a sharp contrast - flight cancelled and no help at airport. Finally booked to fly 4 days late. Check-in the usual chaos with no dedicated C class line. Once through the plane did not appear for several hours. Information very poor left in the lounge for several hours. Finally the plane landed departure delayed until the next morning. Baggage not returned and people left to fend for themselves. Eventually we flew with no proper meal. Red eye flight to London on A340 offered the best seat/cabin served light evening snacks which were tasty and an average breakfast. On arrival in LHR 4 days late I had to wait over an hour for my bag.

Singapore to LHR on 777-300 ER instead of A380 but managed to get two seats together at the back of the plane. Food quality not great and they again ran out of my meal choice for breakfast.

601,Ireland,4.0,1,aer-lingus,,Economy,,8.0,DUB-DUS-DUB. Outbound flight light load had breakfast not bad value and quite tasty. Remote stand in DUS but efficient transfer via bus so no complaints. So return last night full flight (215 people). Departure at 9.20pm. At about 8.30 at gate announcement made asking everyone to go downstairs collect bags and exit for bus transfer to Cologne where our aircraft was! Turns out curfew at Dussledorf means no jet aircraft after 10pm. Inbound flight was delayed which would have prevented a departure prior to 10 resulting in an overnight. All handled pretty well to the point that obviously this was not the first time this happened! Bit of a pain back through security etc in Cologne and people who had bought duty free in Dussledorf had some issues. Ended up arriving in Dublin at 1am about 3 hrs late. Flight itself fine. My only comment is on one attendant. Few German lads in row opposite me having a few drinks. A bit spirited but nothing to bother anyone. In fact the young attendant on board had a few laughs with them chatting about best pubs to go to in Dublin. Then as other attendant passing they were a bit loud and I noticed her giving them a hard stare. I travel a lot and know when people are behaving in a poor manner but not in this case. She had a furious look the whole trip. Ok so like the rest of us on a Friday night not impressed running so late but we were all in the same boat and I thought the passengers were remarkably stoic and took it all on the chin.,0.0,10/28/2013,4.0,,3.0,3.0,A Foley,0,0,0
602,United Kingdom,4.0,1,blue-islands,,Economy,,7.0,Guernsey to Paris return via Jersey last weekend. Outbound flights and connections went well with great cabin service including champagne lager tea coffee and good quality rolls and snacks. Return flight was disappointing. An elderly aircraft really showing its age. In fact the seats in the row in front of us were a completely different style to the rest! The air conditioning didn't work which was unfortunate on such a hot day particularly as we had to sit in the plane on the tarmac at Paris for around 25 mins. Some of the no-smoking signs didn't illuminate - not a problem but reinforced the impression of a rather shabby plane. Very cheerful cabin crew. Arrived in Jersey for our connecting flight to Guernsey only to be told it had been cancelled - it was a bank holiday Monday and apparently they never operate that flight on bank holidays and we should never have been able to book it through their website! So what should have been a one hour connection at Jersey turned into 2.5 hours. Again not a huge problem but for an airline that pitches itself as something above the norm it was a bit disappointing. Fares were good value and flight times to and from Paris were convenient (aside from the delay on the return).,,5/6/2014,,,,,A Ford,0,0,0
603,Canada,1.0,0,sunwing-airlines,,Economy,,1.0,22nd Dec. Huge Ice storm delaying operations out of Toronto Pearson airport. Any other airline had delay information posted on the screen and vouchers for passengers to purchase food inside the terminal. Sunwing had nothing the agents knew nothing. Flying on 513 to Cancun. We find out after 2 hours of sitting on the aircraft that we had been offloaded and our suitcase was not onboard. I inquired to the agent about my luggage if they could load it on since we had 2 more hrs to wait they said yes and I was reassured that it had been placed back on. Passengers had been waiting for more than 4hrs with not one drinks service. I had to tell the crew to turn the lights from bright to low. Since it was a new 737-800 the CSM had no clue how to operate the system. Sandwiches shouldn't of been served after such a long delay. They were soggy cold and the paper was stuck to them. Arrive at destination no luggage. Return flight same thing delay 2hrs no APU closed door stuffy cabin with a more pro- active crew that instantly did a water service. I would rather pay the 100$ more to fly any other airline. Landed in Toronto to be parked at a bridge that did not work.,2.0,12/31/2013,1.0,,1.0,1.0,A Forest,0,0,0

Cannot believe there were no monitors in the back of the headrests instead monitors on the ceilings so far away you could barely see. The so called inflight entertainment (1 film for a 8.5 hour flight) broke after 10 minutes of starting and was off for an hour then anyway. When the ""food"" turned up I was given some cold pasta as there was no chicken left so it was this slop or nothing it was inedible so left it. On the way home there was a 2 hour delay and a gate change from 1 to 35. This time I got chicken but service was done in the dark and again only one film for a transatlantic flight so no distractions there or back which meant plenty of clock watching.

A protracted process followed whereby Glasgow passengers were transferred on to the Edinburgh flight which was delayed by over 2 hours. On arrival at Edinburgh we were transferred 40 miles by bus to Glasgow Airport. This would have been bad enough but I also had an interesting conversation with two East Midlands staff who told me that the airline had also pulled the Glasgow flight in similar circumstances on the previous 2 days. It seems that Flybe are cancelling flights on economic grounds but remain happy for passengers to turn up at airports in the full knowledge that their flights will not be operating.

Once the flight was announced, everyone just lined up and boarded. None of the convuluted boarding typical of airlines in the US and it only took about 15 minutes to board the plane. Since checked bags are free, there was no hassle for overhead space. Plane was economy class only with decent seat pitch. No extra charge to choose seats. Despite being a short flight, cabin crew came around with a complementary snack box and beverages. Plane was an older 737 but in reasonable shape and clean - I have flown in much more dilapidated planes on the legacy carriers. We had made a mistake on our booking for the return but were able to call BOA and rebook for the next day. Again, only paid the fare difference, in this case about US$8 each. Return flights (with connection in Cochabamba) were on time and the crew managed a snack service with drinks on the 35 minute flight from Cochabamba to La Paz. On the shorter flight from Sucre to Cochabamba they handed out snack packs to everyone. All in all a very good experience. Crews and ground staff generally pleasant and efficient.

Given the circumstances I bought the tickets on Friday morning no delays were listed and I went straight to the airport. There the flight was initially delayed from 14.20 on Friday to 6.50am the next morning according to the representative at the desk. At the same moment received a text from Norwegian to say that the flight was delayed until 11pm the same night. No one knew what was going on. Eventually the flight was delayed twice more first until midnight on Saturday (a 32 hour delay) and then again until 8.50am on Sunday morning (a 40 hour delay). At this point I have been waiting at Gatwick for hours while the flight was pushed later and later. The final delay would have had me missing the funeral and no would could guarantee that further delays would not be incurred. I had to cancel my ticket and book a new one with BA for double the price which left right on time and gave me no issues.

They fly the Newark - Porto route twice/week and the Newark - Lisbon route the remaining 5 days. I paid only $789 for the round trip multi city flight and although I couldn't pick seats until 24 hours prior to departure I got window seats both ways and a bulkhead window seat on the return from Lisbon to Newark (11j)! Food was decent/edible although they were a little stingy on wine and tea/coffee ( they only fill glasses half way and are bad on refills). The A332 from Newark to Porto was newer then the return aircraft and had touchscreen on demand entertainment with dozens of movies including new releases like 12 yrs a slave and Dallas Buyers Club. The return A332 had personal TVs as well but the movies were on channels 1-16 and started at a set time. Flew Portugalia operated Fokker 100 to Brussels from Porto which was fine. They served a lox sandwich. Food on the return Lisbon to EWR flight had descent food - fish pie (like shepherds) and a prosciutto sandwich as a snack before landing.

But at least we were upgraded to Business Class. 48 hours before the return flight I received an email from BMI saying the Beirut-London flight had been cancelled. At this time I was in northern Iraq on a mobile phone. It was very difficult dealing with a call centre in - I think - India. Initially they insisted that it had not been confirmed that the flight had been cancelled - despite the earlier email! At length they re-booked us on an earlier flight. As a result we lost a day in Beirut. On checking in for the earlier flight I asked for an upgrade by way of compensation. This was refused. The check-in girl claimed (falsely I believe) that upgrades could only be done from London! This was the first time I'd used this airline - and it will be the last time.

In general the service was good and we all enjoyed the food very much. There was a problem on the route from Singapore to Brisbane in that our seats were in the centre block and for some reason the crew kept missing us first we got no food (they ran out just as they got to us then started serving people around us but not us) and in spite of several attempts to get their attention they ignored us. Eventually my husband had to go down and ask them for food. The stewardess was very apologetic. I also noticed that when seatbelt checks were done on that flight they didn't actually look along our row. I witnessed a couple of people pressing the Call button and getting no response at least for quite a while. On the same flight the entertainment monitors were unreliable. Mine didn't have sound for a while and my son's just stopped working. The other legs of our journey were quite good and I was impressed that our luggage reached our final destination efficiently. I did find the legroom a bit cramped but that was more to do with the pillows and blankets. The main problem on the final leg of our return journey was a child a couple of rows behind us that just cried incessantly for almost 16 hours. Being a night flight we'd hoped to sleep most of the way but the whole section of the plane around the child was kept awake. There seemed to be no bassinets on our flight so no doubt the child had to try to get comfortable sitting on parents lap? The crew were no doubt also affected by the crying but what can anyone do in such a situation?,4.0,6/8/2014,4.0,,3.0,5.0,A Genner,0,0,0

Return leg on Sunday evening due to depart at 20.05 was delayed by 5 hours and we were only told about this half an hour after we got to the airport. They knew about it the previous day because it was caused by an aircraft going completely out of service in Gran Canaria. So standards of aircraft maintenance are obviously not the greatest! In total we had to spend 7 hours in Prague airport and all we got was a 255 Kc voucher each worth about £7. The airport restaurants are expensive so this didn't go very far. Eventually got home at 3am when we both had to go to work the next day. The very least they could have done is text or emailed us when they knew they'd be an aircraft down 24 hours before the flight and we could have spent more time in Prague.

The plane left 15 minutes late due to the poor check-in. Once on board we were seated down the back this seems to be where they put all the young families a bit like a flying crèche. If the kids are going to scream let them all scream together. Prior to the flight we received an email from Virgin to download the entertainment app for the flight.

The trip down on flight 581 was severely delayed. Taxied down the runway only to have to come back to the gate when a warning light on the navigation system came on just before take off.

Thankfully after a few more minutes they let us off the plane and kept us in the terminal.

Flight 580 the next day was better in some ways worse in others. Again taxied down the runway and were next to take off when a warning light came on. We sat on the runway for about 30 minutes waiting for the issue to be fixed. Sadly the crew was very rude both in person and on the intercom barking orders and coming dangerously close to a yelling tone with passengers. This was not my first poor trip with Allegiant but it will be the last. The low ticket price is no longer a selling feature since they gouge you on fees for everything including printing a simple boarding pass. Driving to SeaTac Airport is about the same cost when you add in all Allegiant's fees but comes with the added peace of mind when it comes to mechanical soundness and pleasant staff.,0.0,10/31/2014,2.0,,3.0,1.0,A Gipe,0,0,0
673,United States,1.0,0,frontier-airlines,,Economy,,1.0,"I arrive at the airport 2 hours ahead of time to find the Frontier line out of the door. There were two extremely slow agents and a slew of broken kiosks. After an hour in line I finally got through security to find out my flight was delayed. Because of this I would miss my connecting flight. Frontier rebooked me on one of their later itineraries - one that would get in 3 hours 17 minutes later than my original itinerary. Even though there was other flights available on other carriers I was booked on this flight. After doing some research on Frontiers website I found Frontier's policy about controllable flights. ""If we can't get you on a Frontier flight scheduled to arrive within three hours of your original itinerary we'll do our best to arrange for you to fly on another available carrier or combination of carriers with whom we have agreements."" After bringing this to the attention of the agent at the gate I was booked on another connecting flight on another airline. Then I found out our original flight was cancelled so I would miss my new connecting flight. While standing in line at the gate trying to rebook my flight I was told I had to go back to the ticketing counter to do so. I had been standing in this line for 45 minutes already. I proceeded back through security and waited in another line for an hour and a half line to try to rebook to get on a new flight. I cannot believe an airline could be so incompetent.

NBO-LHR departed over an hour late as aircraft was parked at the wrong part of the airport so we were made to sit in a tent on the apron in darkness until someone got fuel for a generator once on the aircraft it was again a rather tired 777-200 ER and was again in a seat which probably hasn't seen a cushion in 10 years! NVOD still didn't work which made for a long flight. Food was marginally better. Again I cannot fault cabin crew who were very attentive.

I have been a regular customer on Cathay Pacific's premium economy between Perth and Hong Kong and I have been very happy with the service until now. On my last flight Perth to Hong Kong instead of the usual hot or cold breakfast options we were given a box containing a pastry fruit salad in a tiny dish and a chocolate bar The same meal was served to economy passengers. when I asked the flight attendant where was the hot food I was informed that there had been a change to the service. Downgrade more like it. I asked for a glass of Champagne and that was served in a plastic cup. On the return sector Perth to Hong Kong we were given a hot lunch which was quite good and then around 9pm they came down with a box containing the worlds smallest chicken roll some fruit salad in a tiny plastic container and a chocolate bar. Cathay Pacific is a premium airline this food is not fit for economy let alone premium economy. They seem to have downgraded the service but not discounted the price of the ticket. I will be flying back to Hong Kong next week it will be interesting to see if they have lifted the standard of meals back to what it once was.,4.0,4/27/2015,3.0,,4.0,1.0,A Godfrey,0,0,0

I could only choose where I wanted to sit 24 hrs before my flight which was fine as most airlines have that policy but what really threw me back was that all aisle and window seats cost an extra $69 - $100 each way depending where the seat was located! You have to pay extra for an aisle seat at the back of the plane on a 10hr transatlantic flight? This is not easyjet or Ryanair for goodness sake! The so called cheap flight on a major airline was not so cheap after all as they were already nickel and diming before getting off the ground. I refused to pay and went for a free middle seat which I loath I have wide shoulders and have to hunch inwards my plan was to arrive early and hope the check-in desk could sort me out with an aisle seat which they were able to do but that is where the Customer satisfaction stopped.) Plane was on time and boarding was reasonably quick and I was perched in my aisle seat which was very narrow I also noticed many people getting their roller cases stuck in the aisles as they tried to roll them down but it turns out that in an effort to squeeze an extra seat in each row American Airlines compromised with narrower seats and aisles. In the air nightmare #1 The narrow aisle caused one particular cabin crew to bump the trolley into my shoulder or elbow without even so much as an apology. #2 You get free beer and wine but the entire cabin ran out beer and white wine before the first drinks trolley finished its first pass. #3 The plane was old and the only movies available played at set times (not on demand) that's right 2015 with 90s technology - AA may have painted their planes but they are still old and nasty inside.

Pilot informs us in mid-flight that the plane will have to make a stop in Munich for crew change. All 70+ passengers were fully frustrated with the sheer incompetence of SAS staff and the lack of proper communication to the passengers. Majority of passengers were flying to LHR from Oslo. However SAS would not help make arrangements from Munich to LHR for any of the passengers. Instead told passengers to wait 2 more hours in Munich and get back on the plane to Oslo. Lost complete faith in SAS' ability to get its passengers home in a timely manner. No care of duty shown towards its passengers. SAS had no staff providing any info in JTR airport nor in Munich. Limited communication from Lufthansa reps on behalf of SAS at the gate in Munich.

Continental equipment. Business cabin was the same as you would get on a domestic US flight. Seats didn't recline much no foot rests no in seat power and overhead monitors. Vegetarian food options were bad mostly soggy grilled vegetables and tiny portions. They also seem to have barely enough for the people onboard. They also seem to ration the alcohol and don't serve it very willingly. On the PTY-REC flights they serve a snack first instead of a meal. They serve the meal 2 hrs before you land at 11 pm at night.

On the way over we had a very friendly cheerful crew but on the way back the flight attendants were very snappy and unbelievably inconsiderate to passengers that didn't speak English or French. The food was mediocre compared to the meals I got on the connecting FRA-MAD leg on Lufthansa which is sort of disappointing for a 9-hour flight versus a 2 hour flight. The selection of wine was worse than Iberia Regional offered on MAD-GRX no less. It's not a huge deal to me I didn't expect to eat and drink like a king but when you look at what other airlines are offering I can't help but feel embarrassed for my national airline. The IFE system was decent with a good variety of TV shows and movies. Unfortunately the in-flight map didn't work on the return segment but that's a very minor complaint.

TAP is a good option against the LCC when going to Europe as they offer competitive rates and include all meals and baggage. It must be said that their Lisbon hub is not the best due to the lack of signs and long walks between gates when transferring.,2.0,8/23/2012,3.0,,4.0,2.0,A Griggs,0,0,0

711,United Kingdom,2.0,0,ethiopian-airlines,,Economy,,2.0,Flew LHR-ADD-ZNZ and return (via DAR). Unable to check in online for every flight as they changed the type of plane for every sector at the last minute. Flight to ADD was fine but we sat near the back of the plane be warned that the crew use the overhead bins for storage of snacks/breakfast items. Towards the end of the flight they closed one of the 4 toilets and had to use that as storage due to the lack of space on the 757. ADD-ZNZ (via DAR) departs from T1 where there is absolutely nothing to do or see. ET do not hand out arrival cards so they have to be filled out once at the airport. By far the worst flight was ZNZ-ADD where they brought out a smaller plane (737-700 instead of 800) which meant the plane was felt extremely cramped as there was a 100% load. Finally ADD-LHR was fine apart from they insisted on serving a full meal at 03.30am and then a small muffin and juice just before landing. From what I saw 60% of the flight didn't take the main meal and slept through. In my opinion it would have been better for them to serve the muffin at 3 am and the main meal for breakfast when everyone was awake.,1.0,4/16/2013,1.0,,2.0,3.0,A Griggs,0,0,0

When comparing their fares to other providers you may be tempted to save a few dollars but trust me it is not worth the headache. Keep in mind that they will be nickel and diming you for everything from baggage to drinks to printing a boarding pass. In my first experience with spirit the flight was delayed 3.5 hrs and we were given no reason. On my second the flight was delayed 5 hours due to ""weather"" from the departing city. When I asked what the departing city was they noted Myrtle Beach SC. Sure enough weather.com shows sunny and delightful all day in Myrtle. Overall I'd say Spirit is not worth the money.

Seating was a bit crammed but get what you pay for. The nicest part was the effort on the part of the airline to keep us all seated together without trying to gouge us or blow us off like other airlines. Customer service appears to still have a pulse with Icelandair. There was only a slight delay with one of the four flights but we still managed to leave on time. We read about the food for pay thing ahead of time and packed our own meals. Our child's airline provided meal was brought hot and early in the flight and she was happy with it.

Made it through immigration and security easily but struggled to find the correct lounge. Once there it was not worth the effort. Uncomfortable seats and well worn furnishings. Strolled down to the gate and learned that departure time is the real boarding time. Fought my way through the line onto the bus and then shoved my way to the stairs and made the climb. I found if I didn't assert myself I would keep getting cut in front of the line. Once onboard seats were old style angled beds. Service was courteous and smiles were plentiful. My jacket was ignored until about 3 hours into the flight. My meal order was taken chicken ordered and beef delivered. Debated pointing this out but decided between my language skills and the crew's skills I should enjoy the beef. I think there were inflight announcements from the cockpit but they were difficult to hear. I did have to ask for water about halfway into the flight and after asking got regular top offs.

They had plenty of advance warning and could easily have planned ahead. (And I was flying on a ""non strike"" day.) When British Airways went on strike several years ago management actually worked as flight attendants to prevent interruption to their service. That is customer service and Icelandair should pay attention. No one at the Icelandair customer service kiosks (in any airport) seems to know what's up.

Morning meal more standard fare but fine. Air Canada has come a long way in service over the past few years and I would definitely choose them over any American carrier and many European ones. I thought the dinner meal was better than what I ate on united first class. UA could take lessons from AC.,4.0,8/5/2014,5.0,,4.0,4.0,A Hall,0,0,0

They looked tired lacking of sleep and seem to disappear for prolonged periods! Food excellent for special meal. The rest no different than other airlines and short of JAL. Online booking facility a bit outdated. Seat selection facility in flash always crashing. The worst with ANA there is no area to leave feedback online no proper call centre with extended hours. Basically if you miss 17:30 you are stuffed. I find it very absurd especially that they operate in other countries with different time zones to be able to offer 24h telephone support!

I asked two different employees for a Supervisor and both of them told me there wasn't one. I had to go to a different airline and they got me an AA supervisor. The own AA employees outright lied to me about a supervisor. They scheduled me on a 6am flight the next morning and yet again they had issues. They had defuelling issues on the plane and everyone had to deboard. They are now trying to get us on a different plane. Do not fly with this company unless you want to pay a lot of money for a ticket to arrive a day later and potentially lose your luggage.

I printed boarding passes ahead of time on the first leg but when I arrived at LCCT the bag drop off lines were longer than the normal check-in lines and it took well over an hour with no clear indications of where to go. On the return flight from Seoul it was incompetence by the check-in staff which led to 2+ hour long waits. I arrived at the airport 3 hours early and had to run to my flight to catch it after clearing check-in security and passport control. It takes 30 seconds for me to check- in online but for some reason the check-in crew are taking 15-20 minutes per pax. Other than check-in everything else was fine.,,1/5/2011,,,,,A Hardig,0,0,0

The flight to Shanghai was canceled due to airport facility problem and stranded passengers were taken to a hotel. Around 0:00 AM we were suddenly required to depart and took a flight to Kunming. We arrived at Kunming around 2:30 AM. The airport staff said the passengers to wait in a hotel until the alternative flight to Shanghai which departed at 10:00 AM. However they said I (and another passenger) had to take another flight which departed at 9:00am and did not give us a hotel room. Instead they took us a dirty smelly office and said us to sleep there. Since the only one sofa was occupied by the other passenger I had no place to sleep other than the floor. I complained about the change and requested a decent place to sleep but they were just saying ""No"" and did nothing except saying I was not the only one who had no room and what I could do was to wake up an employee and ask him to share his room or sleep on arrayed chairs. I tried to get a room by myself but the nearest hotel was full and they said there was no taxi or bus in the midnight. I was forced to spend the night on a dirty hard floor while the others were sleeping in a hotel. Of course I was not able to sleep at all and felt sick.

756,Australia,3.0,0,royal-brunei-airlines,,Economy,,3.0,We found the Royal Brunei Airline experience was not good for families with young children. The only positive was that air hosts/esses were generally helpful and friendly. In our purchased tickets it said nothing about the additional stopover in Dubai. This was very unsettling for little ones trying to sleep then had to walk the circuit of Dubai airport waiting over an hour only to get back on the plane. Then a wait of 2.5 hours before it quietened down enough for them to sleep. Kids meals were not great and our children are not normally fussy. Kids entertainment was also poor. I would definitely recommend taking your ipad. Finally as we left Heathrow to travel back to Melbourne we purchased some gifts. Being aware of the alcohol restrictions on the plane I clarified this with the sales assistant who assured me it was ok to take aboard. Nothing was mentioned about the alcohol when boarding on the plane at Heathrow. Nor through the Dubai check. However at the last point it was confiscated in Brunei. Everyone felt extremely frustrated and angry that this was not made clear before purchases were made. Obviously no one would have wasted their money if they knew it would be taken away. Overall I would not recommend this airline to families with young children.,2.0,10/18/2012,4.0,,4.0,2.0,A Hare,0,0,0

This flight was already booked otherwise there was no way I'd have flown them again which was very fortunate for me. The equipment was their new airbus and made all the difference. This was an excellent experience and compares with prior ones that I've had with Finnair. I'm happy to report that they deserve their 4 star rating. In my prior review I would not have given them a three. I flew Bangkok to Helsinki and then on to Madrid return in business class. I would recommend them highly and especially so with their excellent pricing. The seat was a little tight. I found it somewhat difficult to to get up for breaks. Definitely tight.

Great crew and adequate entertainment. Departed CDG a little late but made up time to land Havana more or less on time. Return journey not so good. aircraft booked solid. Had no choice of seat.

There was access to the Air China lounge at PEK T2. I didn't visit the lounge on the return at FNJ. On the flight PEK-FNJ there were no more seats so a North Korean teenager sat in the flight attendant jump seat for the whole flight. On the way back the security guard sat in the flight attendant jump seat and she sort of sat on the very edge of the same jump seat and held the wall for take off and landing. They also kept the curtains closed to the front of the aircraft which in the event of an evacuation would be a no-no because people couldn't see to get to the exit.,,10/9/2010,,,,,A Harris,0,0,0

Truly a 4 star airline. Sad to say that is no longer the case. The plane was an older Airbus A340-300. The seats are not 180 degrees so difficult to sleep. The entertainment system was very poor. A small screen and less than 20 movies on offer. The food and the wine were the worst part. Two reds both 2012 and hardly drinkable. The food is worst than AA DL and UA and that's saying something.

Once we finally boarded the aircraft the staff were very friendly and all of them were willing to help you with anything. Seats on the B737-400 are not very comfortable due to the hard padding the tight legroom and the footrest which takes up even more of your legroom. Apart from the wide seats and smaller cabin I honestly felt like I was sitting in economy. Once we were all settled in the purser came around offering us a choice of drinks before take off. Not long after we took off the light snack was served. On this flight the snack was Cold Teriyaki Chicken with Salad which was not very nice.

There also seemed to be no comprehension of a simple western breakfast: muesli yoghurt fruit and a hot cup of tea or coffee.

To avoid check-in queues I recommend the online check in it took 5 minutes at the luggage drop. Economy is a fairly comfortable although legroom is tight and for tall passengers I recommend paying the extra amount for one of the ""hot seats"" (either front rows or exit rows). The check-in did offer to block off 3 economy seats for me for an extra fee (as there was space on flight) but as a day flight I did not need to sleep. I was very impressed with the meal which also comes with a bottle of water. Other onboard food purchase items reasonably priced and a fair variety. I was looking forward to my return flight in Premium class. No need to do online check-in for Premium as there is a dedicated check-in queue for maximum of 12 Premium passengers. No business lounge for Air Asia X (pay per entry Plaza Premium Lounge available). Onboard staff offered a bottle of water lots of overhead space with only 12 passengers in the premium cabin. All passengers given a blanket and cushion. After takeoff staff offered to serve meal at a time of my choice. They also offered to hold any additional food items that I may want later in the flight. The standard meal is the same as that offered in economy class. The main benefit of Premium is the almost lie flat seat.

Also very lucky on the return flight as it was practically empty we were given a glass of champagne! This time got 1 small main meal (and didn't eat the salad as it consisted of one small leaf and lots of dressing that tasted of dish water) afternoon tea consisted of 1 biscuit and tea or coffee steward gave me a look when I asked for 2 drinks and only good thing about the entertainment was the selection of films. I don't know why the stewards seemed stressed when the plane was half full! Also on return flight back staff at the airport had an attitude and didn't even welcome or say hello to me! They insisted I put items from my hand luggage into my suitcase as it was 1 kilo over! All this wonderful service cost me just under £800 for a return ticket! My friend flew with American airlines (via Miami) and basically got the same service and quality food and drinks I had from my original Virgin flight 10 years ago.

Boarding was really slow so I got to stand around on open steps for several minutes whilst people got their stuff packed. When I got on board my carefully chosen window seat turned out to be next to a screaming baby. I swapped with one of the parents so I was then one row away from a screaming baby. On a flight with unallocated seating I would have picked a seat 15 rows away. The next time I flew with them they made me pack my carry on bag in the hold. There were seats which were near empty luggage bins but the bins near my allocated seat were full. It meant I had to hang around waiting for my bag to arrive when I should have been on my way home. They are trying to act like a premium airline but without the infrastructure or the organisation. It takes too long to board so they end up running late. If I'm boarding from a sky bridge then its not so bad to have to wait whilst people find a specific seat.

When they finally did appear they told us that the delay to the inbound flight was due to severe thunderstorms in Gatwick earlier on in the day but every flight before and after it had already left Gatwick so clearly something else was wrong. They eventually told us that the aircraft was now fully boarded in Gatwick and was awaiting one more crew member they would inform us of its departure. The aircraft landed at 01.50 and we were called forward for boarding immediately leaving us standing for 10 minutes - not what we wanted having been awake since 05.00 the previous morning. Boarded just after 02.00 and took off at 02.25. The captain explained that the delay was due to thunderstorms but in addition the aircraft had technical problems forcing a replacement aircraft to be found and a new crew also had to be sourced. We were in the last row of the aircraft which had no window and was cramped due to the tapering in of the fuselage at the rear. This in addition to the annoying racket the cabin crew were making in the galley made sleep almost impossible. It was 03.45 by the time we disembarked in Gatwick check in for our next flight was already open. To our horror the aircraft parked at the South terminal (replacement aircraft had next flight from there) meaning that passengers and baggage had to be taken over to the North terminal where the flight was destined. Fortunately baggage arrived quickly which was a huge relief because we had to change back to the South terminal in time for our next flight where we finally arrived absolutely exhausted at 04.15. To top it all off easyJet sent us an email saying that the delay was due to adverse weather alone and so we are not entitled to compensation.,,11/12/2014,2.0,,2.0,0.0,A Hibbert,0,0,0
787,United Kingdom,4.0,1,british-airways,,Business Class,,9.0,DME-LHR July 23 Club World seat 64A. It was quite a novelty travelling on a 747 aircraft for a flight just over three hours long. I sat on the upper deck which was full but this did not detract from the excellent service provided by the two dedicated crew. I chose this seat as no one has to step over your feet when they exit and it is also a fraction longer than the other seats with three windows and four compartments beneath the window to store items. I did not use the seat as a bed but used the Z position which is very good for relaxing. The food and wine choices were very good and the Club Kitchen was well stocked on the main deck for treats after dinner.,4.0,7/29/2014,4.0,,4.0,4.0,A Hickling,0,0,0

There is lots of space to place items and the seat has different positions from arm chair to fully flat bed. The seat also has a built in massage function. The TV screen was 15 inches in size and operated from a remote in the seat.

The space is more noticeable than a 747 or 777 equivalent with a wardrobe that can fit carry on baggage a jacket and shoes plus a side bin that accommodates other items. The food was excellent with the choice of a five course taster menu with accompanying wines or a la carte. There are also treats available in the first galley. Breakfast was also very good. I managed to get plenty of sleep as the aircraft is very quiet and walked around the entire plane to get a sense of scale. The crew were excellent addressed me by name engaged in conversation whilst delivering an unobtrusive service. The entertainment system was the Thales product. Plenty of choice interactive screens and no rebooting as is the case on other long haul aircraft. I couldn't fault this flight just a pity I couldn't spend longer on it.

791,Germany,4.0,1,germanwings,,Economy,,5.0,On a recent trip from Stuttgart to Stansted I had the window seat in a row which was also occupied by a young mother and her four or five year old daughter. The minor took the seat next to me. Once we had achieved cruising altitude the mother produced an iPad from her bag and placed it on the table in front of the child. Then without the slightest consideration for their fellow passengers a Mickey Mouse movie was run with the soundtrack coming to all in earshot over the speakers. Since it was a reasonably short flight I plugged my own headphones in a did my best to ignore the cartoon. Now that such technology is available I think it might be high time for Germanwings to regulate such behavior. Obviously a sense of social responsibility is no longer sufficient.

Ticket bought at the last minute a bit expensive at 7k+ but cheaper than Delta. For a direct flight between these two cities there are no better choices. Terminal 2 at PEK airport is the most convenient terminal easy in and out. Will have to fly this routes several times this year and will choose Hainan again. One very attractive benefit of flying Hainan business class into Beijing if you make prior arrangement via phone or website they will provide free transportation to and from PEK airport in a MB car.

It seems to me that your luck is down to the aircraft you fly on. The Premium cabin extra legroom is definitely worth it as we travelled back with Virgin en Economy which was far worse. All the complaints seem to be petty (films on loops no free drinks person in front reclined seat). We really enjoyed the flight and glad I did my research before hand and was prepared with my own drinks and my own films on tablet. Not difficult really. Food was excellent but I'm sure James Martin did not prepare it himself as it seems some of the reviewers wanted! Cabin crew where helpful and polite and no different to Virgin Staff. Word of warning on hand luggage - 6 Kgs only so make use of the 23 Kgs in the hold. Overall I say ""hats off"" to Thomas Cook for offering an alternative to Virgin with no frills and making everything very clear on their website including the information on cost for drinks. I will certainly be paying half price compared to Virgin and fly with TC again. I understand that next year the food will be included in the ticket price and some beverages.

Row numbers were called in increments of 5 logically starting from the back.

If I were James Martin I wouldn't want my name printed all over the food cartons! Cabin staff were unwelcoming and quite surly once we informed them of out dissatisfaction and disappointment when we compared the 'upgrade' to that offered by Thomson on the same route previously. One replied 'well you're not flying with Thomsom now'. Shall not fly with Thomas Cook again and would not recommend to anyone else on the basis of my experience. It's the first time I've ever been hungry and thirsty on a long haul flight. Not looking forward to the return flight.,1.0,2/3/2014,1.0,,3.0,1.0,A Humphries,0,0,0

The Malaysian airlines first class is not as impressive in comparison to other first class A380's out there on the market. It lacked style and good cabin ambience. It felt like MAS simply had to put a first class in for the sake of it and didn't really think through the idea. I've thought that MAS was the leading carrier in south east asia and hope that it will redesign its first class cabin.

The crew were helpful with my carry-on luggage on board. There were some problems with the passenger call bell button and it was quite worrying. (Probably just an old aircraft. The seats looked old and dirty but overall very spacious and comfortable. The cabin seemed warm and stuffy throughout the flight though). Safety and budget transportation was definitely the main focus of the airline. In safety aspects the crew did their seatbelt checks after the turbulence announcement and constantly doing toilet-checks and house-keeping often. Announcements by the crew could be improved in terms of clarity audibility and tone of voice. I did not try the inflight entertainment and purchase any meals. But the menu of the inflight meals and the list of inflight entertainment seemed interesting and a bit on the steep side.

Had flown into Madrid on a BA codeshare from Heathrow and legroom was probably better than on the long haul Iberia flight. Seat on Iberia has a box which severely reduces legroom. Inflight entertainment was poor however we had prepared for this and knew about it beforehand. Food was pretty good and cabin crew were reasonably approachable. Landed in Quito 20 mins late. Return flight: At check-in they told us that our pre-reserved seats had been sold to someone else. A departure tax had been retrospectively added a cost which Iberia should have absorbed. Flight to Madrid involved a technical stop in Guayaquil. Flight between Quito and Guayaquil was delayed however the real shocker was when the plane had to turn around an hour after leaving Guayaquil and make an emergency medical landing. Significant delays were caused. When had taken off for a second time out of Guayaquil we were carrying a 4.5 hour delay. When we finally landed in Madrid we were advised that there were no available connections to Heathrow that night so we needed to overnight in Madrid to fly out the following day. Iberia agent who helped us with hotel vouchers etc. was quite helpful and had clearly exhausted all possible routes to London. Stayed overnight at a hotel at Iberia's expense and the following morning to the earliest flight back to London arriving 15 hours later than scheduled.

I travelled long hauls about 10x a year with various airlines (mostly Etihad). Crew were very efficient serving meals within 40 minutes of take off in a full cabin! However surprised by lack of choice. Plastic cutlery which is not very premium like. Plenty of drinks and crew answers call very fast indeed. Despite a busy flight the lavatories were cleaned frequently. The most by any airlines I've flown with so far. The crew were hard working and professional smiling and they interacted well with passengers. Its the small details that makes this crew the best I've flown with. Some might not like it but at least doesn't feel robotic. TV screens were big and selection of movies were good enough. Headsets were ok. Definitely the highlight is the crew not even the A380 size could beat it.

No additional food or drinks provided even though the overall delay was 4 hours. During the flight the cabin crew were very inattentive instead talking with each other almost non-stop and at one point all moving to the forward area to talk. The curtain does not mask noise and for those of us near the front it was impossible to sleep due to the cabin crew being so selfish.

871,United Kingdom,5.0,1,royal-brunei-airlines,,Economy,,10.0,Of all my recent experiences flying LHR-MEL I would consider Royal Brunei to be the best. The cabin crew were genuine and attentive and being there for passengers was their primary focus throughout the flight. A big selling point was the additional seat pitch giving a sense of space and comfort. The recline was good. The entertainment system worked perfectly well. Meals were of similar quality to other carriers however were a little more generous than the offerings of some others and a lot more generous than those offered by BA and VS. Check in was simple and efficient in both directions and travelling through Brunei Airport was a joy. Small quiet no ridiculous long distances to navigate and not daunting in any way. I also prefer having two stops (3 x 7hr legs) between the UK and Australia as being in the air for 14 hours on the now standard 1x7 + 1x14 hour leg is nothing short of horrific. I would choose Royal Brunei on this route over all others.,4.0,6/19/2013,5.0,,5.0,5.0,A Jarrett,0,0,0
872,Canada,1.0,0,jet-airways,,Economy,,,Prince George to Vancouver on Flight WS3282 no issues at all. Second part flight from Vancouver to Las Vegas WS1788. A major delay and staff member onboard was unfriendly with a poor attitude. Third part Las Vegas to Vancouver WS1789. Flight crew on that flight were unfriendly and seemed annoyed when asked questions. We had originally booked and paid more to connect in Vancouver to Flight WS3293 with a 1h 20 min connection so naturally we felt a little rushed but felt this was ample time to connect flights. Upon arriving at the gate it took forever to get all the passengers off. We had asked for a cart to speed things up from the plane but were denied and told to speak with the Westjet desk outside of Customs. We rushed to Customs and were put through very quickly by CBSA. Because of the Customs rules we had to wait for our luggage which took well over 25 minutes to collect. We went to the Westjet connection desk we were told we had been re-booked for a later flight at 2130hrs. When we spoke with a Westjet attendant she couldn't figure out why we were re-booked in the first place without our knowledge as everything landed on time. Flight back to Prince George was fine flight wise.

We had to walk for 20 minutes. The ""free"" shuttle wasn't running. There was no one around to help. I strongly suggest that the elderly and disabled avoid this airline. Once you make it through all the immigration and security checks you are stuck in a tacky area with limited food and drinks and extortionate prices which are completely out of line with what other ""international"" transit terminals charge.

Seat was ok but after a 14 hour flight everything seems a little uncomfortable I guess. The only negative was perhaps the craziness encountered at Istanbul Ataturk airport and the uncaring attitude of people at the airport.

Watch out for something they call ""midnight menu"" because what that means is that there is very little to eat. Finnair has decided that no traveller wants to eat a full dinner on this 10 hour flight which I find strange. Last year they served a full dinner on this route but now they have removed the soup the starter the salad and the noodles completely. The meal is just a tray with main course. If your hungry bring your own. No amenity kit provided but you can ask for some things. They were happy to provide me with a toothbrush but I just think it is very strange that you have to bother the staff for every little thing you need.

On my return our flight was cancelled due to technical difficulties. Things were chaotic and there didn't seem to be a plan to deal with this. I was forced to stay for 48 hours extra at a hotel. The support were not located at the Dulles airport so they couldn't help me with my hotel accommodation. They only had one flight out from Dulles each day so their local personal arrived around 3pm. Yes it's cheap but if something goes wrong expect to have some extra trouble.

On both legs rafts took up significant portions of the overhead storage space and on the return flight my seat back was broken and would not stay upright my air blower barely worked which was not pleasant considering how hot the cabin was. Finally my flight out to Taipei was delayed 3 hours and they actually served us our breakfast while still at the gate.

886,Canada,1.0,0,air-canada-rouge,,Economy,,1.0,I had no idea what Air Canada Rouge was until after I had booked. We found a good deal online from YVR to HON for spring break so booked. Flight was on time leaving YVR and aircraft seemed clean and tidy but seats were a bit cramped in terms of leg room and elbow room. The flight attendants were all very friendly and bubbly as one would expect from new grads - I liked the attempt to look trendy with the uniforms. What was disappointing though for my two young children was that there was no in-flight entertainment. It would have been helpful to know that one needed the iPad app ahead of time. Also disappointing the lack of good available - you would think Mac and cheese would be the obvious to stock up on this flight. What was extremely disappointing was to find out the day of checkout was that our 10.15pm flight had been delayed by 4 hours. What was even more aggravating was to find out through 3 further emails that our flight was delayed even more. The final straw that broke the camel's back was to check in and then find out that our flight would be delayed 7.45 hours. So here I am sitting in Honolulu airport writing this in frustration at 4am because I can't sleep and have two exhausted children on hand. Had we known this earlier we would have just booked a hotel room. What I find insulting is the airline's idea of compensation for this is $10 meal vouchers - what a slap in the face. On top I find it ironic that the airline is 7.45hours delayed which is just under 8 hours on their website for which they would provide accommodations for. I'm sitting here in the airport probably with 100+ passengers looking as exhausted and frustrated as I am and probably thinking the same thing - never again. As I peruse the Internet wish I found this website earlier as I hear this is not the first time this has happened.,1.0,3/18/2015,4.0,,2.0,1.0,A Johnson,0,0,0
887,United Kingdom,1.0,0,thomson-airways,,Premium Economy,,,Flew to Cancun on 5th August TOM28. There were 3 of us 2 adults and one 7 year old. Having missed out on a holiday in 2013 we decided to treat ourselves and upgrade to Premium. I cannot fault the outbound flight. Priority check-in with separate baggage check-in and separate security passport control all taking no more than ten minutes or so. Staff - friendly and attentive got customer care spot on. Came round with drinks trolley numerous times. They were happy to make conversation and made a fuss of the kids. Food was good with a very good choice - sparkling wine or orange juice was offered pre-flight which was a lovely touch. Separate meals for the kids. Snacks offered with drinks and some small chocolate bars offered. The individual mini desserts were particularly good and the inclusion of an afternoon tea prior to landing was again well thought out. The plane: Nice wide leather seats with moveable head rests lots of leg room with pop up leg rest blankets pillows and a travel bag with toothbrush eye patches ear defenders all a nice touch. The actual plane noise was minimal with auto dimming on the windows. Inflight entertainment: Good selection of movies for adults and kids nice quality headphones handed out once seated there were also music channels some interactive games and some drama and comedy channels a pretty good selection with some quite new films. Now the bad the return. 19 Aug TOM 29. We were so disappointed after having a fantastic family holiday no welcome onboard. All extras that had been handed out to us on the inbound flight - head phones etc were just thrown on your seat The three women and one guy barely managed a smile let alone spoke to customers. I was reading my magazine and I had a menu thrust over the top. Food trays were whisked away swiftly. The main meal was a poor reflection on the outbound meal. Main course was as uninteresting the dessert was written on the menu as a chocolate indulgence - well it was one squirt of vanilla whip and one chocolate whip on a piece of sponge. Drinks offered with meals. We did not see the waiting staff for about 6 hours as they eventually pulled their curtains and were not seen till breakfast not even to check everyone was ok or offer water etc. There were supposed to be two different inflight entertainment menus one outgoing one return.

Only recommendation is to not take too much carry-on baggage as there is limited storage space. Both ways the flight attendants were helpful and happy. Great addition to both flights were the FAs who stopped to have a chat to passengers after they had served the small snack - either a museli bar or packet of shapes and either tea/coffee/water. On the flight up we were delayed 90mins due to mechanical problems. The weather in Byron meant some baggage had to be taken off so extra fuel could be put on board in case of diversion. Staff were helpful and dealt with it in a professional manner sending the remaining bags up on the afternoon Virgin flight. I'd recommend REX over Virgin and Jetstar. I payed less than half for the REX airfare than what the other two were offering and was twice as happy flying with them.,,1/21/2009,,,,,A Johnson,0,0,0

No staff were at the bag drop before 1hr 50 mins before departure by which time there was a huge queue (back to the door of the terminal). At the beginning only two desks were manned and it took us over an hour to get to the front of the queue. However once our bags had been tagged we had to join a further huge queue with our bags to put them on a conveyor belt! The staff were rude and disinterested. Fortunately the security staff and passport control were quick and efficient and then we had to queue again to get into the gate. The gate had virtually no chairs and we ended up standing and queuing for over 2 hours. In fact the only free time we stole for ourselves was 5 minutes to go to the toilet. A truly awful experience.

Our traveling parties were meeting in PHL to connect to the same transatlantic flight. Both flights delayed due to weather but they go in to PHL at around the same time. Our flight then sat out on the tarmac for 1.5 hrs because they didn't have a gate for us. While we were stuck out there the captain kept saying all flights out were grounded so we would make our connections but that wasn't true as mine left leaving me stranded. Next flight waited for passengers to come in from a delayed flight. Why couldn't they do that for me? I finally made it to Glasgow the next day via London but missed the first day of vacation. On the way back our flight was delayed 2 hours due to maintenance and the next one was as well. On top of all this the staff were rude pushy and the flight attendants were surly the meals were gross and the TV sound did not work throughout so that was 7 hours with nothing to watch.

How anyone can not be impressed by the A380 beggars belief. We had seats in the rear on outward front section on return and it's incredibly quiet compared to the 747! Plenty of leg room (I'm 6ft) and comfortable seats. Food quality was good too I've flown Thai quite a few times and the food as been excellent every time for me Emirates was not far behind. Plenty of drink runs and flight attendants were helpful and courteous. The ICE system needs hardly any mention it's simply superb especially on the A380.

On the LHR-MNL leg it appeared that the FAs were new on the job and appeared nervous were stumbling a lot and did not know how to properly serve.,3.0,6/20/2014,3.0,,4.0,4.0,A Jose,0,0,0
908,United Kingdom,2.0,0,kuwait-airways,,Economy,,1.0,I traveled to Columbo Sri Lanka in January 2014 with a stop over at Kuwait City on the outward and return journeys. The airport itself was like most no good or bad points. The flights on the other hand were shocking. The outward journey was bearable but only because the plane was only half full. The journey back to the UK was disgusting the staff (all male in economy) were rude and argumentative they ignored us. At meal times I had to ask for our dinner as they passed us by. The toilets were filthy toilet paper all over the floor the floor itself was soaking and not cleaned throughout the journey. The inflight entertainment was poor half the TV's on the seats didn't work if they did the sound was poor. There were no alcoholic drinks allowed on the flight so it was soft drinks tea or coffee. I could go on but I think I have made my point.,1.0,7/3/2014,1.0,,3.0,3.0,A Joslin,0,0,0

On the plane from Toronto to Abu Dhabi the cabin staff were more interested in selling duty free goods than serving passengers any food. I had to ask the flight steward to serve breakfast to my son who was awake for at least 45 minutes. The trip from Abu Dhabi to Trivandrum was good. The lounge was good but Terminal 1 was crowded and poorly organized. There was a long line up to check in and business class passengers were not given any priority. On our trip back the 13 hour flight from Abu Dhabi to Toronto was a disaster. They only served dinner and did not serve any food afterwards in business class! I had to ask for a cup of coffee which arrived minutes before landing in Toronto. I don't think I will be travelling Etihad again unless they change their service to passengers.,3.0,1/6/2014,3.0,,4.0,3.0,A Joseph,0,0,0
910,Australia,5.0,1,emirates,,Economy,,10.0,I flew SYD-BKK in Sep 2014. This was my first time flying Emirates though certainly not my first time flying. I've flown quite a few of the greats (ie Cathay Singapore Malaysian Qantas etc) but Emirates completely impressed me. I flew economy and the furnishings and ambience felt and looked better than most economy cabins I've been in. The service was fantastic. Friendly and fast. Not to mention the flight attendants were immaculately groomed well-presented and spoken and quite attractive (male and female). Their overall demeanour was professional friendly and classy. This is in stark contrast to other airlines (ahem Qantas) whose cabin crew look and act like they'd rather be elsewhere. The food was good and plentiful and the in-flight entertainment was excellent.,5.0,9/19/2014,5.0,,5.0,5.0,A Joven,0,0,0

For international flights I avoid them like the plague as they are expensive and the service is sub par. This particular flight was BKK-SYD and I was just relieved I was able to secure an aisle seat (with the added bonus of the spot next to me being unoccupied). Online check in was not available for this flight for some mysterious reason. The cabin crew need a lesson in grooming and customer service ASAP. All of them looked bored and somewhat angry. The service as usual was disinterested and disconnected. Breakfast was just thrown at the passengers. One of the ladies looked like she just rolled out of bed and one of the male attendants needs to shave so as one doesn't look like they've been awake for 24 hours. The food service was mediocre (as usual). Most notable was their 'breakfast' which was a small muffin yoghurt and orange juice. Please note that in their domestic flights (ie SYD-MEL) this is almost the same amount of food that's served. In a 9 hour flight with a 4 hour gap between the dinner and breakfast service one is left rather starving.,3.0,9/19/2014,2.0,,3.0,3.0,A Joven,0,0,0
913,Ireland,4.0,1,etihad-airways,,Economy,,8.0,Dublin - Abu Dhabi - Bangkok return economy March 2014. Frequent Flyer and Etihad gold card holder. Etihad are a good but no longer great airline. All flights were punctual. The lounge in Dublin is fantastic. All flight sectors were very busy. Food onboard was OK. The food service onboard seems to take an extortionate amount of time. Also Etihad leave the main lighting on for too long on red eye flight. They should make better use of the mood lighting for those that want to sleep. The seat pitch on the A330 was not good and I could not sleep. The Boeing 777 aircraft with 10 abreast seating and narrow aisles feels cramped but easier to sleep on. The crew were friendly and professional on all sectors. They currently appear to be more interactive and helpful with passengers. I was impressed as I was greeted by name on one sector. IFE is good. Etihad now seem to have a policy of boarding almost an hour before scheduled departure which seems excessive to me. We were sitting on the tarmac after boarding for a least 30minutes on all sectors and I was one of the last few to board. There are still issues with the landing slot in Dublin airport in the morning as no stands are available to park at. Another delay after a 8 hour flight.,3.0,4/8/2014,5.0,,3.0,4.0,A Joyce,0,0,0

A day before departure I was called to be informed that the flight 'might' be cancelled. The uncertainty helped make it a stressful day. At check-in was informed that the flight was not cancelled but we may be changed to Azerbaijan Airways for the Dubai leg and have an additional stop. Finally arrived at Dubai only to find out that our 5 checked in pieces of baggage primarily the children's items had been sent to Cyprus. Promised to have them in 24 hours but took over 3 days. To make matters even worse I had to go back to the airport to collect the bags. Overall I would pay the extra next time to fly with a more reliable carrier.,1.0,1/2/2013,1.0,,1.0,1.0,A Jumani,0,0,0

First off I should say that I had problems in booking via the Santa Barbara website and so had to visit their agency in Quito. I had my bags fairly thoroughly checked by migration people in Quito but that's understandable given the flow of drugs in the region. The flight itself was fine: Boeing 767 no obvious neglect crew were friendly enough food was decent. We did leave about 30 mins late. At the Caracas end our bags were slow in arriving.

I then had to stand at the front of the plane until the entire flight boarded so they could find me an unused seat to which they said 'I'm sure you'll be able to stay on this flight'. Afterwards due to a mishap with my belongings I had to call the airline company several times. Not only did I have to wait 15-20 mins each time to speak to someone they would then proceed to tell me complaints and questions can't be made over the phone.,,9/10/2011,,,,,A Kadubiec,0,0,0

The flight was scheduled to take off from Singapore at 1.45am and arrive into Sydney at 12.40pm. The flight got progressively delayed and finally took off around 5.30am. Then for some unknown reason it stopped in Perth before continuing to Sydney. Finally it landed in Sydney over six hours behind schedule at 7pm. I missed my onward connections to Canberra. So moral of the story is that if you have to reach somewhere on time do not travel by Scoot as they are usually late.,2.0,2/19/2014,1.0,,2.0,1.0,A Kale,0,0,0
919,United States,5.0,1,allegiant-air,,Economy,,9.0,TUL to SFB flight and back after a weekend. The main motivation to use this airline was the affordable price and a direct flight to desired destination. We did our homework and were mostly pleased. This airline asks you to sacrifice comfort and charges less for it. If you demand extra they charge you extra. Have your boarding pass ready and be at the airport early. Print out your boarding pass as early as you can to get the best seats it is very important if you would like to sit with the person on the same reservation. Pack light. We just used the carry on allowed bag that has to fit under the seat. This also allows you to go straight to your gate. All check in bags and bigger carry on ones will be charged extra. The seats do not move but bring your own neck pillow. They allow a lunch pack and I had it with me so did not have to buy any food on the plane. Well I did buy a can of ice tea for $2. Bottle of water was also $2. Make sure you have an acceptable credit card for that. Restrooms are free! I did not like that the flights I took were both late. 30 and 45min. Not sure why. Seemed like that the first flight had been placed with the different plane (new airbus) since the seating arrangements were off and the second flight had some turbulent weather. Second plane was really old Douglas 80. Staff were nice and helpful. People do forget that this airline is different and demand the same service as on other airlines. Then they get frustrated if they get charged. I think I will fly again with them.,1.0,4/7/2014,5.0,,4.0,5.0,A Kant,0,0,0

922,United States,2.0,0,kuwait-airways,,Economy,,2.0,It wasn't just the shabbiness of the cabin poor leg room lack of inflight entertainment delays but more especially the sense that Kuwait Airways doesn't care at all for the comfort welfare or opinions of its passengers. It exists simply to transport people from one place to another at a cheap fare. Not a great feeling when you're on a transatlantic flight for 7 hours. My husband and I booked a round trip flight to from New York to London and back before reading any customer reviews. I read them after we had already made the booking and then dreaded the trip. To my surprise the flight from New York was fine. The plane wasn't crowded and a kind steward moved us into an empty bulkhead seat so we would have more leg room. There were no undue delays. We didn't mind the lack of inflight entertainment or alcohol on board and I was prepared to give Kuwait Air higher marks. Then we flew home. After going through security at Heathrow in London we found when we got to the gate for our flight that we had to line up and go through another security check by Kuwait Air staff. The line was delayed when they thought a French woman didn't have a visa for the US and went away for several minutes to check on this. My husband was next in line and they didn't bother to check his backpack in which he had accidentally left a tube of antiseptic cream. 300 people many with children had to go through this line. Once past this there were no toilet facilities or drinking water available in the waiting area. On board over an hour later we were handed earphones then snacks then ordered to shut our shades. Then 2 hours later ordered to open our shades wash our faces hand back the wash cloths without delay eat dinner. No one had the nerve to disregard all these commands issued by a tiger lady who never smiled or spoke politely to any one except some young Arab passengers blocking the aisle while she did so. Almost no one left their seats until nearly the end of the flight. No assistance was offered to mothers with crying children. As we left the plane I asked a steward at the door what the earphones were for. He said with a broad smile that they were for the inflight entertainment! I just laughed at that. That was my inflight entertainment. I put it all down to a cultural experience until then foreign to me. But I don't really need a cultural educational experience when I'm in a plane.

Both flights had a delay of around 15 minutes which is perfectly normal. The only drawback was that both planes were old and the seats rather worn.

Baggage labelled with other passengers name. I had to point error out and girl attempted to get bag retrieved. Promised it had been fixed. Luckily other passenger also going to Gold Coast as on arrival bag not on carousel. Found it at baggage services still with other passengers name on it. Meant I spent 45 minutes waiting for bag. Flight to Sydney delayed nearly an hour by fog but no delay information. No entertainment on any flight and food very poor! Has anybody actually been on a Virgin aircraft that has their mysterious entertainment system? A very small cold chicken pasta salad with a revolting chocolate mousse is not what I would call a Gourmet meal as Virgin describes it. Email then sent to my home address whilst away rebooking my flight home as direct at different time with arrival into Melbourne 5 hours before connecting bus home to regional Victoria. No phone call despite Virgin having my mobile number. Had to ring them to get flights changed. Would not put me back on flights I had booked and very insistent I flew on flight they wanted me to!

Service is ok for such a short flight even though there was a lack of standards like napkin with the drink or even a cup with the water bottle. They don't serve snacks in economy on a 40 min flight. Unusual for somebody used to the local carriers excellent service. Zurich airport is fantastic! Quiet well organised and nice to look at. The long haul flight to MIA was of good standard. IFE is slow and a bit old fashioned. Service and food was ok for a 10 hours flight. The two girls on our side of the plane were very friendly courteous and helpful. I have to point out the impeccable state of the restrooms throughout the flight! Arrival in MIA was hassle free as we were the only international flight arriving at that time (6pm) and all immigration officers were there only for Swiss. Return from LAX also no drop-off zone for baggage again pre- checked-in online. Treated ourselves to a paying upgrade into business class. The seats are nice and good. Not my favourite though. The food concept is ok and especially the service routine for breakfast was confusing to me: No information about the options on the menu card which makes it even harder to pick a choice from the service cart and it all was on demand. Espresso service is great! All of the cabin crew were really nice caring and friendly. The downturn was the 'maitre de cabine' who was rushing down the aisle with her service cart and lacked proper service enthusiasm and should have taken her team as role models.

No priority check-in for Business Class passengers told that we would be ferried to the plane on a separate bus once it arrived no such thing happened Business Class passengers last to board the plane.

948,Canada,4.0,1,lot-polish-airlines,,Economy,,7.0,YYZ-WRW-PRA return last week. We flew to Warsaw on Air Italy chartered by LOT. Check in took 90 minutes. Hideous food inedible. No special meal provision for low sodium though reserved. Warm drinks served twice and never replenished though on their website LOT recommends one glass of water per hour. A few insolent and unhelpful staff. Not enough washrooms. The flight to Prague was on time well staffed clean. We arrived at Prague Airport on May 8 at 1200 for a 1430 flight to Warsaw and a connection to Toronto. The flight to Warsaw was delayed 40 minutes and we were worried that we would miss our connection. The gate crew at Prague arranged for a wheelchair for my partner who was unable to run through Warsaw airport. The flight attendant made certain we would be met at the gate and brought directly to the Toronto flight and flight was held for our arrival. We appreciated this service. The flight Warsaw to Toronto on LOT equipment was comfortable enough bathrooms and drinks. The marvellous measure of their service was that our luggage made it too!,,5/9/2011,,,,,A Kemper,0,0,0
949,Australia,2.0,0,cathay-pacific-airways,,Economy,,2.0,Travelled on CX100 to Paris on 16 April 2015 and returned CX111 14th May economy class. Both flights were full except for a couple of seats. Overall my trip was average. Limited number of toilets for that many people. Food was minimal and bland compared to other airlines. On my first leg of the trip the sound was not working and the only choice I had was to move to the very back of the plane. It totally spoilt my trip. There was no foot peddle to rest your feet on so the pressure is reduced to the back of the legs. This is very important for 'short people' to reduce the risk of DVT. All other airlines flying the long leg have them. The water given to passengers was very metallic in taste and not drinkable. When we flew out of Hong Kong the security staff suddenly set up a barrier just before entering the plane and confiscated all the passengers water bottles and duty free bottles. How is this acceptable when the duty free stores sell you alcohol only to have this confiscated before boarding. They said this was an Australian ruling. A number of people requested bottles of water when entering the cabin but were refused. Why wasn't there an announcement before entering the aircraft that bottled water was not allowed. I would not have bought my new bottle and OJ prior to boarding. We could only get the 'metal tasting water'. The crew were accommodating but that's all. The seat in front of me did not stay completely upright. The man sitting in it was large but I felt that he would collapse in my lap any moment.

952,United States,2.0,0,american-airlines,,Economy,,1.0,"After a 6 hour delay originally attributed to a broken air conditioning component estimated to take ""45 minutes"" to fix myself and several other passengers changed our tickets to another later flight to the same destination. After being boarded on that second aircraft we were informed that the ""maintenance log had been removed from the aircraft and not returned as expected"" so we would need to wait until it was located. Initially this appeared to be mere incompetence but swiftly came to seem like subterfuge. Fully an hour later we have just been told there is a panel on our aircraft that has to be replaced. This is supposed to take 1 hour. Meanwhile our original aircraft remains grounded without further explanation. As a passenger I am apprehensive flying on aircraft in such poor repair and moreover feel deceived repeatedly by gate agents and flight crew who are either misinformed themselves or deliberately trying to hide the sorry state of American's fleet.

953,United States,2.0,0,allegiant-air,,Economy,,,Feb 20 2015 from Punta Gorda Fl. to South Bend IN. I have emphysema and spinal stenosis and need a wheelchair to get through security and to the plane. I can walk certain distances but not as far as through airports and to planes. My friends drove me to the airport but had to get a wheelchair for me because they had no one to do it for me. Then they did not have anyone to push me through security and to the gate so my friend had to get a pass to push me through all that. At the gate an older man with a cane came over beside me and there were some wheelchairs sitting there so he got one to sit in and asked me if I knew why there was no help for us. Usually handicapped people are boarded first along with people with children and first class passengers. This did not happen with Allegiant Air. They boarded a long line of what seemed to be a lot of first class passengers and I don't know who else before the actually asked the older gentlemen if we needed help to the plane. They finally pushed us to the plane. My assigned seat was in the second row so I don't know where the so-called first class people were sitting. The biggest insult came after landing in South Bend IN. They announced that people waiting for wheelchairs were to remain on the plane until all other passengers were gone. I was surprised to see several wheelchairs sitting just outside the plane door but no people to push them. Finally someone came and pushed me into the airport. Another point against Allegiant Air is when I tried to print my boarding pass it wouldn't let me. This is usually because I have to carry a POC (oxygen concentrator) to use on board. I printed the page telling me this because they charge $5.00 if your boarding pass has to be printed at the airport. Foolishly I thought since I showed them I couldn't print my boarding pass they wouldn't charge me $5.00 but they did without telling me. It just showed up on my credit card. The two women at the ticket counter were unfriendly and at times downright rude. The attitude was this is the way it is so take it or leave it. It is not an airline I will ever fly again.,0.0,3/4/2015,1.0,,3.0,0.0,A Kincaid,0,0,0
954,Australia,3.0,0,cathay-pacific-airways,,Economy,,4.0,Flew Heathrow to Melbourne. It was a pretty terrible experience all round. First flight to HKG was a 747-400. The seats were bizarre they did not recline but the seat slid forward a little bit and the support for the bottom of your back is rock hard. Terrible pockets on the seat in front mean if you put anything more than a newspaper in there the seat pocket is touching your knees. Also as with all Cathay flights I've been on there was no personal air conditioning control. Food as always was terrible - 2 meals on a 12 hour flight both of which were not nice at all. Breakfast choice always seems to be an egg based dish or seafood congee. I'd rather just have cereal next time. The dinner is always a choice of an oversalted Asian dish a vegetarian pasta dish or something else unappetising. Having already flown the opposite route we luckily knew to take snacks on board so we didn't starve. With Qantas / Emirates I usually end up feeling almost overfed not with Cathay though where you feel like you're in prison. With 2 or 3 hours before landing when breakfast was about to be served my girlfriend noticed that a child on the seat in front had been sick which had trickled between the seats and gone all over her tracksuit pants which were on the floor in front. We tried to get the cabin crews assistance but they continually ignored us. We ended up just putting them in a bag and then throwing them away. Never again! I'd rather pay an extra $300 to fly Qantas / Emirates than fly with Cathay again.,3.0,10/1/2013,3.0,,3.0,2.0,A King,0,0,0

956,Canada,4.0,1,allegiant-air,,Economy,,5.0,Our second trip travelling with Allegiant and for the most part we are happy with our flights to first Hawaii and now San Diego. However travelling from San Diego on April 20 we were concerned with the lack of communication about gate location. Since we printed the boarding passes the night before we expected no firm boarding gate at that time. When we arrived at the airport without checked in baggage we went directly through security as we usually do. However past security on the airport monitors there was no reference to our flight at all. All other airlines had the gate and time of departure clearly listed. We walked the airports 40 plus gates looking for any indication of which gate we should depart from. We then asked airport staff and they could only suggest we find an Allegiant agent which we could not. Again all other airlines were clearly provided with gate and departure time but not Allegiant. Finally we called Allegiant customer service and were on hold for 30 minutes. The person we finally talked to was after some delay was able to provide a preliminary gate assignment but suggested it might change. When we finally did find it even the monitor at the gate indicated gate closed. Rather than relaxing before our flight the time past security was quite stressful and at time we wondered whether we were at the right terminal. Communication is very important to passengers. All it would likely taken was a quick call the airport staff to get the monitor situation corrected. We will fly Allegiant again.,0.0,4/22/2014,3.0,,3.0,0.0,A Kirk,0,0,0

My partner and I checked in online in the morning prior to the flight. We arrived to the airport and waited at the check in counter as they were getting another couple checked in printed boarding passes checked luggage and sent those passengers on their way to the gate. They however denied us help denied offering any customer service or compensation because they said we had arrived too late to print off boarding passes but they did admit to use that they had knowledge of our online check in. Then while we were standing at the counter with 4 other passengers Spirit Airlines proceeded to book flights and offer hotel and ticket compensation to the other passengers.

Cabin crew friendly. Leaving the plane at Warsaw delayed because it seemed impossible to find steps that would reach to the right height of the aircraft door. Same problem on return leg. On the outward flight seat pitch was comfortable but on the return seat pitch was very cramped and uncomfortable. Luckily the plane was not full and no-one sat in the middle seat of my row but this is not ideal for a long flight. I used their minibus service from Warsaw airport to the city. As we arrived late at night and with a delay I was pleased the bus had waited. Driver friendly but drove like a maniac down long straight roads with little traffic from the airport and through a few red lights.

Check-in online with actual access to seat map that allows you to chose your seat would make a lot of frequent flyers of all categories much happier. Flight attendants are overwhelmed with issues because of the random automatic system booking. Families are scattered all over the plane. Even after take off there were still people trying to reunite.

At the time Rouge had just started its international service so we didn't know what to expect but it's Air Canada right? It has to be at least decent. I have to say at this point thank goodness we changed our return flight date which meant we went from a Rouge flight to a regular AC flight. Travelling over 8 hours to Italy in those cramped circa 1970s metal framed seats was not fun and I had the luxury of a 4 year old next to me so I could use some of her space. I am not a tall person and I felt like my knees were in my armpits the entire time because of the ridiculously small seat pitch you can't actually recline your seat more than an inch maybe two inches. Fantastic for an overnight flight. At least they gave us pillows and blankets. Hardly any of us slept and it was a long boring flight since we don't all have ipads and theirs were booked. I'm curious to know how there is still no Android app for their stupid in-flight entertainment system but I digress. People also need to know that the reviews here are accurate regarding the overhead bins they are not regular carry-on size each bin could fit maybe 1 item - for 4 seats! I would also like to point out that flying Rouge is definitely a buyer beware activity. I'm not sure if there are any cases of the prices reflecting the ""bargain airline"" thing they are trying to be but I think it is all kinds of insanity to charge the same for this service as for regular Air Canada flights. I know this is true because AC had a schedule change that meant we went from a regular flight to a Rouge flight and the gentleman at the call centre warned me that we would be getting less service for the same money. In fact he was required to explain that to me and I had to agree and it was made clear that this would be recorded so that there would be no ""misunderstandings."" As a result I got so nervous I changed that flight to a different day to avoid having to fly Rouge home and thank goodness for that. Two of our party were in business class on Rouge that meant Premium Rouge or some such silliness and they had slightly bigger seat space and a curtain to divide them from the steerage behind on Air Canada they had pods with lie flat beds for the same price. I'm sad to say that this is no exaggeration. Now if I pay a little bit of money for a discount flight on a bargain airline okay I expect to get what I paid for - not much. But when you are paying full Air Canada fare and get bargain airline seats and service I'm not okay with it.

I asked the hotel saying that this was the deal buying the ticket and it is not possible stay at the restaurant for 65 hours. He answered saying that the time for to fix the visa is about 2 hours and after that I'll have short time at the hotel. After 30 mins they eventually took us out without visa and passport!

Never had any delays actual departure in many cases before the scheduled departure time. Extremely friendly and cheerful crew. Only complaint the rather expensive food and drink onboard and not accepting Indian currency on international flights.,1.0,5/30/2013,5.0,,3.0,3.0,A Krummacher,0,0,0
981,Thailand,4.0,1,srilankan-airlines,,Business Class,,7.0,BKK-CMB-FRA return in business class. On all flights except the CMB-FRA sector we had their new lie flat business class seats. It was quite upsetting that this configuration was not available on the long CMB-FRA flight moreover as this was a red-eye flight. Check-in in BKK quick and efficient given priority passes for security and immigration. Lounge in BKK is Air France - quite sterile and no real food. Service on board was excellent delicious meal served. IN CMB boarded from the bus gate air conditioning not working and business class boarded last - weird! Luggage in FRA came out last despite being tagged priority. On the return flight quick check-in at FRA. UL is using the JAL lounge - quite poor choice of food available. Great dinner on board but not sure why they serve a 2nd dinner just before a 5am arrival in CMB. Serendib lounge in CMB closed due to renovation used another old fashioned lounge but was quite ok. Flight to BKK left 30 mins late. Delicious breakfast served on board. Entertainment on all flights quite a joke. Choice extremely limited and the AVOD system in business class is almost impossible to navigate. Luggage in BKK came out first. UL business class product clearly has some shortcomings but given that the ticket is only nominally more expensive than an economy class ticket on some other airlines it is still a good choice and value for money.,2.0,7/29/2013,5.0,,4.0,5.0,A Krummacher,0,0,0
982,Belgium,4.0,1,csa-czech-airlines,,Economy,,9.0,BRU-PRG-BRU. Altogether very satisfied one flight with older 737 the other with new A319. Check in procedure was smooth and uncomplicated in both cases. The flight with A319 was very nice with inflight screens with maps. The flight with 737 was bit worse as it was an older plane. The food and drinks on both flights were quite well for nowadays standards on European flights. The crew both in plane and on ground very nice and helpful.,,9/12/2012,,,,,A Kucera,0,0,0
983,Russian Federation,3.0,0,china-southern-airlines,,Economy,,1.0,Moscow to Sanya and back. Flight to Sanya (with one change and stop) was ok though food and inflight service is quite poor. Return to Moscow was horrible. Flight from Sanya to Guangzhou was delayed 2 hrs so we missed our plane to Moscow from Guangzhou. Ground service of the airline was very bad. They were slow and spoke poor English. We spent almost 3 hrs after arrival to re-book our tickets collect luggage and wait for the hotel transfer. Flight CZ6001 was very difficult. After check-in the whole flight was taken for a security check 20 min before boarding: you go for the check wait get a card in addition to a boarding pass wait in another zone then go downstairs to a bus collect the card then almost 30 minutes on a bus to the plane. Stop in Urumqi for passport control you leave the plane wait in line for passport control go to wait for the boarding back then take off. They feed you just twice - once between CAN-URC and then once between URC-MOW.,1.0,1/29/2014,1.0,,2.0,1.0,A Kudrewicz,0,0,0
984,United States,1.0,0,air-europa,,Economy,,,Well my trip started out with a fabulous connecting flight from Miami to Madrid and then from Madrid to Italy. The attendants were all so courteous like wise on the way the home. Except for the little fact as to they lost my luggage. Now I understand we are all human and luggage does get lost but what I do not understand is why they do not believe in customer service (a.k.a. returning phone calls or being polite). Not only did they just loose my luggage but once they had located it in the Madrid airport they sent it to Miami to be delivered to me that night. Another problem my luggage was never delivered to me as promised. So again more and more calls and still no call back until finally they responded with Ma'am your luggage is in Havana Cuba. The Customer service is awful and I will not fly with them again.,,6/22/2011,,,,,A Kuchta,0,0,0
985,India,2.0,0,jet-airways,,Economy,,6.0,SIN-DEL Check-in and boarding were quick and flawless. 30 minute delay due to some maintenance checks although captain kept us updated. Onboard A330-200 was in a good condition with a modern cabin complete with large PTV screens new recliner style seats in economy large bins and mood lighting. Seats were at the wider end of the spectrum and legroom quite generous. AVOD entertainment system with large PTV screens was quite good with a wide choice movies. Dinner had 3 choices alcoholic beverages and soft drinks however were limited in choice. Most significant was the cabin crew. Although not rude they seemed committed to doing the bare minimum. Hardly visible during boarding and one quick meal service after that they were invisible for 6 hours. During service they were expressionless and did not seem very comfortable communicating with customers even though they had a reasonable command of English. Overall a very competitive hardware but lets itself down on the soft product.,4.0,4/24/2012,2.0,,4.0,3.0,A Kumar,0,0,0
986,India,1.0,0,hawaiian-airlines,,Economy,,3.0,HNL-SFO. Self-service check-in quick although not enough personnel to help through the relatively complex system. Bags are weighed and you even self-tag the bags before dropping it off. Potentially efficient but the communication needs to be better. However the extra charges are ridiculous on Hawaiian. Check in per bag at $70 movies at $12 extra legroom seats at $70 again. I know American carriers practice ala carte pricing but Hawaiian's charges are more then other carriers. The so-called trumpeted meal service was a few bland pieces of chicken with rice an aged salad and a piece of chocolate. The final straw however was the crew. While sitting on a bulkhead seat after paying the ridiculous charges passengers were trampling on my feet to get to the other aisle. When I advised the crew they said its not their problem. Bags in SFO took ages mitigating an on-time arrival. Sorry Hawaiian but serving sub-standard complimentary food does not allow you to rip off passengers with extra charges and poor service. Next time I am bringing my own food on-board and flying Delta!,2.0,7/30/2013,2.0,,3.0,2.0,A Kumar,0,0,0
987,India,1.0,0,ethiopian-airlines,,Business Class,,5.0,DEL-PEK-DEL Business Class. Outbound check-in surprised to find that there was no dedicated check-in for business class. Boarding was swift and departure on time. Boeing 757-300 was not appropriate for 7 hour flight to Beijing. The product was outdated with old recliner style seats arranged 2x2 with decent legroom and was clean and well-mantained considering the age. IFE from mainscreen was poor and a problem on a day-time flight. Two meals were offered - hot canapes inedible and out of place even in economy class. FAs attentive and professional. A few hours later lunch was served which was much better with generous portions and good quality. Arrival in Beijing was without any hassles. Beijing-Delhi check-in was a mess in spite of a dedicated business class counter - unfriendly and inept staff. The whole process took over twenty minutes. Old Boeing 767 with the same seats but PTV's - IFE choice was limited with 3 movies running on loops. Hardly inspiring considering AVOD being a norm now even on many regional carriers. The dinner was of a high standard. The real issues came when I landed in Delhi. In spite of a new terminal Ethiopian had no clear signage as to where the bags were being delivered. Subsequently upon finding the correct conveyer belt I discovered my priority tagged luggage had not been off-loaded with the conveyer belt showing bags delivered for the flight. The same was with another passenger on the flight. Ethopian Airlines staff could not be found and when we finally found one we came across one of the most unhelpful and petulent staff I have come across. The person was firstly dismissive stating bags would come in later until we had to show him the screen on the conveyer belt. Finally he picked up his cell phone and dialled someone asking for two black bags. No attempt was made to check on the baggage ticket numbers. Finally we waited another ten minutes until he stated that it was time for him to go home and the bags would be delivered. We had to involve the customer service desk at Delhi airport who were helpful and ensured that we were attended to. Planes old punctuality good and inflight service excellent but the outdated product poor ground handling at Beijing and Delhi are major negatives.,,12/30/2010,,,,,A Kumar,0,0,0
988,India,4.0,1,qantas-airways,,Business Class,,8.0,SCL-SYD and SYD-HKG in business. Flight from Santiago to Sydney did not get off to a flying start due to a ridiculous check in system that took 20 minutes at the counter and another 10 minutes waiting in a line for a point to point journey. Unacceptable for business class. Flight was on-time and the Boeing 747 was complete with comfortable fully flat beds which while in a conventional forward layout were incredibly spacious and converted into a full length bed. IFE was AVOD had a good number of options which while not as extensive as some ultra tech savvy carriers like Emirates was wonderfully edited with excellent selections. The food was wonderful with a clear emphasis on fresh food that included a number of options prepared onboard. I loved the flexibility of choosing from an extensive menu at any time instead of the conventional set options at set times. The crew service was mostly exceptionally warm and attentive save for one crew member who seemed totally out of place. SYD-HKG was on an A380 and once again the check in time was far too long although the agent herself was efficient and friendly. Boarding staff greeted me in Hindi. A380 had the same seats and was immaculate. The small lounge area was a nice touch. The catering on this leg was excellent beating the high standards of the previous legs and I can safely say that it was one of the best inflight meals I have had. Crew were friendly attentive relaxed and very efficient. I was overall pleasantly surprised. There are some issues however particularly check in and certain crew and ground members that are marring the work of other staff who are going above and beyond and an airline that is trying to compete with the best in the business and seems to be pretty much up there particularly in terms of product quality. Overall better then BA Swiss Emirates and Qatar. I rate them at par with CX and perhaps just shy of sq. Hopefully their ongoing financial crisis will not let standards slip.,5.0,1/14/2014,4.0,,5.0,5.0,A Kumar,0,0,0

You cannot expect much from a low cost airline but Air Asia certainly hits the bottom when they not only charge a 12 USD supplement for their ""Red Seats"" where you have more knee space (although the difference is nominal) but they also charge a supplement for the other seats as if you could fly standing. But what revolted me most is that you have to pay extra charges for the use of a wheelchair (3 USD per use amounting to 12 USD for a round trip) to make money from handicapped people is a novelty.",1.0,8/19/2013,2.0,,2.0,1.0,A Kupferman,0,0,0
990,France,4.0,1,air-china,,Business Class,,4.0,Paris to Beijing in business class on a 777-300 and return from Shanghai to Paris in business class on A340. Seating on the 777 is excellent with new seats large TV screens and a 2-2-2 configuration. On the A340 the configuration was the same but there were older seats smaller TV screens though I cannot complain about seating. On both legs staff were friendly and attentive. What is disappointing was the quality of the meals. I have seldom tasted such bland food and the presentation was horrible. Before take-off only orange juice and water were served. Wines (good selection of French wines) were excellent but must have been very expensive because there was no second serving nor were liquors offered at the end of the meal. Another drawback was the total absence of reading materials in English or in French except a few China Daily newspapers. A large proportion of the offered movies were oldies. If you are not interested in food if you bring your own reading materials Air China is a good option as it is cheap and not too many people fly it so you have plenty of space.,2.0,5/29/2012,4.0,,4.0,1.0,A Kupferman,0,0,0

993,United States,4.0,1,xl-airways-france,,Premium Economy,,8.0,XL Airways France is a charter airline that has recently entered the US market. I flew SFO to CDG non-stop and paid $500 less per person than I would have on Air France. That's considerable savings! I read you get what you pay for - well I happen to have flown Air France also and they are no different than XL Airways France. The economy in XLF is very similar to Air France with the exception of IFE/ individual screens. You get two meals on a 10 hour flight - a warm meal after take off and a cold meal before landing. One my first leg I upgraded to Premium Economy for a measly $39. The only difference is a few extra inches of leg room (barely noticeable) and leather seats. You still don't get individual screens (only in Galaxie Class or First Class). Crew is extremely friendly and bilingual.,,8/9/2012,,,,,A Kumar,0,0,0

After viewing all those promotional videos from Emirates I decided to use that airline to fly to Riyadh via Bangkok and must confess that I am somewhat disappointed. The lounge in Bangkok is quite plain and sterile with a very limited choice of food. As to the flight itself seats are not ergonomic: the armrest is very short due to the separation panel between seat and corridor and the table is difficult to pull out if you are very slightly overweight. Emirates is quite stingy with amenities and even socks are taken away at the end of the flight if unused. Service was efficient but it cannot be compared with the one on Etihad where you can wine and dine anytime and where the choice of drinks and the quality of food is far superior to what is offered on Emirates. Flight attendants were relatively indifferent. The bar of course is very nice and that is the best thing on that flight. The cabin decoration is reminiscent of a hospital corridor. All in all a flight without surprise but next time I will go back to the friendly Thai people or to the excellent Etihad performance.,5.0,5/27/2015,3.0,,3.0,3.0,A Kupferman,0,0,0
